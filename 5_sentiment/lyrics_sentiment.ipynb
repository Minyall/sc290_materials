        "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is a somewhat controversial technique. It is controversial in the sense that we may question if it is right to computationally measure human sentiment, or whether it is right to 'flatten' it by assigning some text a simple category such as 'positive', or 'negative', or whether we can disconnect sentiment from semantics. For some there is the question of whether sentiment is actually the thing that we should measure in most cases, and perhaps there is a better measurement to 'capture' the phenomena instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Do we want to know viewer's 'sentiment' about a piece of content they just viewed, or do we want to know what they are saying about it?\n",
        "- Do we want to know the sentiment of how people describe their work environment, or do we want to know what it is about the work environment that matters?\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also controversial in that for many years there have been very reasonable criticisms of whether it actually even *works*!\n",
        "\n",
        "Today we'll review a range of methods for conducting sentiment analysis, understand why there are struggles with measuring sentiment, and apply it to some different data sources to see how effective it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you come away from the session 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' about sentiment analysis you should at least understand how it works to the extent that you can critique its use by others, and determine whether it is a valid analysis to perform yourself."

What this means is that each word is pre-assigned a sentiment score, ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive. VADER looks at some text and gives each word its score, and then summarises those scores to give an overall score for the text itself.\n",

Use of emojis ❤️ that may convey sentiment. Words that may intensify, dampen or invert other word's meaning such as \"very\", \"kind of\" and \"not\".\n",
