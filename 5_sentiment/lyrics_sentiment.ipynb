        "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is a somewhat controversial technique. It is controversial in the sense that we may question if it is right to computationally measure human sentiment, or whether it is right to 'flatten' it by assigning some text a simple category such as 'positive', or 'negative', or whether we can disconnect sentiment from semantics. For some there is the question of whether sentiment is actually the thing that we should measure in most cases, and perhaps there is a better measurement to 'capture' the phenomena instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Do we want to know viewer's 'sentiment' about a piece of content they just viewed, or do we want to know what they are saying about it?\n",
        "- Do we want to know the sentiment of how people describe their work environment, or do we want to know what it is about the work environment that matters?\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also controversial in that for many years there have been very reasonable criticisms of whether it actually even *works*!\n",
        "\n",
        "Today we'll review a range of methods for conducting sentiment analysis, understand why there are struggles with measuring sentiment, and apply it to some different data sources to see how effective it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you come away from the session 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' about sentiment analysis you should at least understand how it works to the extent that you can critique its use by others, and determine whether it is a valid analysis to perform yourself."

It makes logical sense but it may change slightly every time which means we can't necessarily rely on it to always return its response in the exact same format. This makes it difficult to integrate into code where we expect data to always be formatted in a specific way.\n",

But he is to join a panel entitled “How can Reform succeed in office? Saving British democracy and lessons from Trump” alongside the rightwing historian David Starkey.</p> <p>Farage will address his supporters inside the huge Birmingham National Exhibition Centre (NEC) on Friday at 4pm, preceded by a 10-minute speech from a mystery special guest. The Conservatives fear a big-name defection but Reform watchers note that Farage does not like to be outshone at his own events.</p> <p>Ahead of the conference, Farage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/03/nigel-farage-called-a-putin-loving-free-speech-imposter-during-bumpy-us-congressional-hearing\">was in the US</a> embracing more openly hard-right rhetoric by calling the influence of Islam in the UK “literally catastrophe”, and praising Donald Trump’s mass round-up of migrants in the US.</p> <p>Migration had fundamentally changed the UK, he told Fox News, speaking before he gave evidence to a congressional inquiry on “Europe’s Threat to American Speech and Innovation”.</p> <p>“You said to me once, you went through parts of London, you didn’t even recognise it to be England,” he told the host, Sean Hannity. “So, please, America, take the warnings. Recognise why President Trump is brave and true and right to control the southern border and to make sure you keep your American culture.”</p>    <p>While immigration will undoubtedly be a major focus back in Birmingham, the official theme of the conference is a bland one, with Reform saying it will focus on “the next step” in its own growth. Since last year’s event, it has expanded from 80,000 to nearly 240,000 members, rising from 19% to 30% in the polls, and securing 900 councillors across 12 local authorities.</p> <p>With Reform having led the polls for around six months, the Tories and Labour are both nervous about the level of business and lobbying attention the party is likely to attract.</p> <p>Heathrow is sponsoring a lounge, while the housebuilder Thakeham, which has previously given almost £1m to the Tories, is advertising in the party’s conference brochure.</p> <p>The crypto industry, which Farage has pledged to deregulate, will also have a prominent presence. Yusuf will be in conversation with Stani Kulechov, the Finnish founder of a company called Aave Labs, while another firm called Zebec Technologies is hosting an event on “strengthening the rule of law” as well as “improving economic competitiveness” through encouraging cryptocurrency and blockchain.</p> <p>The party is also welcoming a tobacco firm, Japan Tobacco International, as host of an event on “revitalising the great British high street”.</p> <p>Climate change sceptics will be out in abundance, with one fringe session on “climate realism” led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/15/farage-and-truss-attend-uk-launch-of-us-climate-denial-group-heartland\">the Heartland Institute</a> and attended by former deputy Ukip leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/18/climate-monckton-member-house-lords\">Lord Christopher Monckton</a>.</p>    <p>For the first time, there will also be a substantial number of fringe events hosted by thinktanks, charities and others, plus a diplomatic presence from the embassy of Israel and the government of Gibraltar.

                  "<p>Good morning. After a bruising leadership contest, Zack Polanski didn’t just win the Green party vote, he cleaned up. His “eco-populist” platform – which borrowed directly from Nigel Farage’s playbook – earned him 85% of votes.</p> <p>Polanski defeated Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, winning 20,411 votes relative to their 3,705 in a ballot of party members. The contest exposed deeper questions about Green party identity and how it positions itself amid a rapidly shifting political landscape.</p> <p>Essentially there were two options for members: a small-c conservative party (which Polanski characterises as over-timid and uninspiring) or a more radical, polarising one (which risks alienating moderate voters). They gambled on the latter.</p> <p>And so a party typically seen as so collegiate and cautious is taking a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/02/green-party-step-into-unknown-zack-polanski-leader\">step into the unknown</a>, voting in a spikier, more media-focused leader. I spoke to the Guardian’s senior political correspondent <em><strong>Peter Walker</strong></em> about what this win represents for green politics, and whether Polanski will woo voters.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/02/rachel-reeves-uk-borrowing-costs-budget-bond-yields\">highest level in 27 years</a>, intensifying the pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, before the autumn budget.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em> | Europe and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/sanchez-europes-response-to-war-in-gaza-has-been-a-failure\">western countries’ double standards</a> over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine their global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Brazil</strong></em> | Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his allies, including four senior members of the military, have gone on trial for allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/02/jair-bolsonaro-faces-justice-over-alleged-attempt-to-usurp-brazilian-democracy\">attempting to stage a coup</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>China</strong></em> | Xi Jinping warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/china-military-parade-xi-jinping-appears-with-vladimir-putin-kim-jong-un\">the world faced a choice</a> between peace or war as he capped a week of diplomatic grandstanding with China’s largest-ever military parade, flanked by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, and the Oscar-winning actor Kate Winslet are calling on Keir Starmer to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/03/brianna-ghey-kate-winslet-smartphone-schools-campaign\"> legally ban smartphones in schools</a>.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘The one thing it won’t be is boring’</h2>    <p>Polanski is a 42-year-old, media-friendly former actor who lives in north-east London and has been Green party deputy leader since 2022. He has previously expressed questionable views about <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/798031/can-you-really-think-your-boobs-bigger/\">hypnotherapy and breast enlargements</a>, and loves going on hostile radio shows and afterwards arguing with presenters <a href=\"https://x.com/IainDale/status/1799884361048678910?lang=en-GB\">over X (formerly Twitter)</a>. His critique of the Green party is that change has been too slow, and as such, the party is getting left behind, not least with the rapid growth of Reform UK.</p> <p>“One of the curses of the Greens is that almost all their senior leaders are just very reasonable people,” said Peter Walker. “They don’t really like getting into these kinds of debates and giving these slightly populist talking points. And I’m not saying that Polanski isn’t reasonable, but he’s more a creature of the more modern age.”</p> <p>Polanski beat Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns who were seen as the co-leaders of choice for party establishment types, including former leader Caroline Lucas. They promised to gradually keep winning more council and parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Of course the Greens are a radical leftwing party (in their 2024 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czddq40z2zno\">election manifesto</a> they promised wealth taxes, nationalised utilities and a ban on some short-haul flights) but they have also made gains by appealing to a larger group of voters who are typically more centre or rightwing.</p> <p>The Polanski wing of the Green party, on the other hand, is more aligned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/03/green-party-leader-zack-polanski-distances-corbyn-electoral-pact\">Corbynism-style politics</a>, saying he would be willing to cooperate in a leftwing alliance with Jeremy Corbyn and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/zarah-sultana\">Zarah Sultana</a>.<strong> </strong> This may appeal to younger, more urban voters but it could scare away older, rural, Tory and Lib Dem-leaning voters. Ramsay and Chowns warned that the Greens risked becoming “a Jeremy Corbyn support act”.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How much will Polanski change things?</strong></p> <p>In terms of policy, probably not much. The Green leader in England and Wales has very limited power (the party didn’t even have a leader before 2008) with members having much more control than they do in other parties. “Even now, the leader has zero say over policy,” said Peter. According <a href=\"https://greenparty.org.uk/members/internal-elections/2025-internal-elections/leader/#ellie-chowns-adrian-ramsay\">to the party itself</a>, the primary purpose of the leader is to “provide visionary leadership and direction for the party”.</p> <p>Leadership contests are generally polite. “Every year I go to the Green conference, write one story from it, and no one really reads it because they do things in this quite sensible way. And there’s not really any big arguments. There’s not any kind of drama,” said Peter.</p> <p>This year’s race has been unusually divisive and attracted more attention<strong> </strong>This is partly down to Polanski, who has generated headlines by announcing his leadership bid to journalists before his colleagues, while also praising Farage’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/farrukh-younus_zack-polanski-i-reject-all-of-nigel-farages-activity-7367123622152380418-ujjd/\">storytelling techniques</a> and the importance of connecting with anger. It is also because the party is getting stronger and there are more people with skin in the game. It now has four MPs and more than 800 council seats, clocking up 10% of support in polls.</p> <p>In debates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/30/keir-starmer-uk-palestine-statehood-gaza-uk-politics-latest-updates-news\">Chowns has been horrified</a> by the idea that the Green party could learn anything from Farage’s campaign style, while Polanski says the opposite. “The leader is the person to whom the media will kind of gravitate towards for any views. And that’s why it could be a significant change, because Polanski is quite a different beast to what they’ve had in the past,” said Peter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/02/zack-polanski-wins-green-party-leadership-election\">In his winning speech</a> Polanski said the political space had become ripe for charlatans like Farage who pretend to serve working-class communities but are actually destroying our democracies, so he felt a moral responsibility to step up and be bold.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What does the Green </strong><strong>party membership make of him?</strong></p> <p>Given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/02/zack-polanski-wins-green-party-leadership-election\">his convincing win</a>, it’s fair to say the<strong> </strong>membership likes him.

His “eco-populist” platform – which borrowed directly from Nigel Farage’s playbook – earned him 85% of votes.\nPolanski defeated Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, winning 20,411 votes relative to their 3,705 in a ballot of party members. The contest exposed deeper questions about Green party identity and how it positions itself amid a rapidly shifting political landscape.\nEssentially there were two options for members: a small-c conservative party (which Polanski characterises as over-timid and uninspiring) or a more radical, polarising one (which risks alienating moderate voters). They gambled on the latter.\nAnd so a party typically seen as so collegiate and cautious is taking a step into the unknown, voting in a spikier, more media-focused leader. I spoke to the Guardian’s senior political correspondent Peter Walker about what this win represents for green politics, and whether Polanski will woo voters.\nUK news | Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 27 years, intensifying the pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, before the autumn budget.\nSpain | Europe and western countries’ double standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine their global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned.\nBrazil | Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his allies, including four senior members of the military, have gone on trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup.\nChina | Xi Jinping warned the world faced a choice between peace or war as he capped a week of diplomatic grandstanding with China’s largest-ever military parade, flanked by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un.\nUK news | Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, and the Oscar-winning actor Kate Winslet are calling on Keir Starmer to legally ban smartphones in schools.\nPolanski is a 42-year-old, media-friendly former actor who lives in north-east London and has been Green party deputy leader since 2022. He has previously expressed questionable views about hypnotherapy and breast enlargements, and loves going on hostile radio shows and afterwards arguing with presenters over X (formerly Twitter).

And I’m not saying that Polanski isn’t reasonable, but he’s more a creature of the more modern age.”\nPolanski beat Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns who were seen as the co-leaders of choice for party establishment types, including former leader Caroline Lucas.

This may appeal to younger, more urban voters but it could scare away older, rural, Tory and Lib Dem-leaning voters. Ramsay and Chowns warned that the Greens risked becoming “a Jeremy Corbyn support act”.\n***\nHow much will Polanski change things?\nIn terms of policy, probably not much.

                  "<p>After a summer recess dominated by headlines about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/farage-aims-for-hardline-vibes-with-his-mass-deportation-plan\">Reform UK’s hardline immigration proposals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/27/essex-epping-bell-hotel-protests\">protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers</a>, the home secretary returned to parliament seeking to wrest back control of the narrative.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper has announced a flurry of tough asylum measures including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-to-make-it-harder-for-refugees-to-bring-family-members-to-country\">suspending refugee family reunion applications</a>, and even floated the idea that refugees could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/02/cooper-reeves-starmer-green-party-leader-badenoch-devolution-latest-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68b6ee0e8f08020a75f11cde#block-68b6ee0e8f08020a75f11cde\">moved out of hotels and into warehouses instead</a>.</p> <p>She promised MPs that ministers were doing their bit to help those fleeing persecution, in “the British way”. But will ministers be caught between its promises of compassion and tough talk of migration?</p>  <h2>What has happened to the refugee family reunion process?</h2>  <p>The government has temporarily suspended new refugee family reunion applications as ministers want to prove that refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions “as everyone else”.</p> <p>People who have had their asylum claims accepted will now have to apply through the standard family scheme that applies to UK citizens, who are required to show that they have a joint income of at least £29,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.</p> <p>Cooper said changes will be made to the family reunion routes process, and will eventually become law in spring.</p> <p>Campaigners have warned this is one of the only safe, legal routes available for refugees fleeing persecution or war to be reunited with their partner or child. Some MPs have highlighted remarks Cooper made four years ago, when she said: “If there are not safe, legal routes for family reunion we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”</p> <h2>Will there be an end to hotel accommodation for asylum seekers?</h2>  <p>The government has vowed to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. At least 32,000 asylum seekers currently occupy them at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Ministers say they will need to be closed “as swiftly as possible” but in “an orderly and sustainable manner”. Government insiders say they expect five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close by the end of the year, with more to follow in the new year.</p> <p>As of Monday, single adults who are granted asylum will be given 28 days to move out of their temporary housing. Ministers have reduced the existing 56-day timeframe to help reduce the number of people staying in hotels. But it could push more asylum seekers on to the streets.</p> <p>Cooper went further on Tuesday after her measures dominated the front pages. She suggested asylum seekers could be housed in warehouses. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the government was indeed looking at “using modular buildings on industrial sites, ex-military sites”. A timeline has not been outlined for this.</p> <h2>How has the asylum appeals system changed?</h2>  <p>Judges will no longer have power to hear appeals made by asylum seekers. Instead, the government has set up a new independent body “staffed by professionally trained adjudicators” to ensure high standards. It is hoped that this will operate in a similar way to the magistrates system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts. Ministers hope this will speed up the process of asylum appeals.</p> <h2>Will asylum seekers be returned to France?</h2>  <p>Ministers have been referring to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-one-in-one-out-deal-allow-uk-return-small-boat-migrants-france\">UK-France agreement</a> as a great example of how the government is taking action to “smash the gangs” by returning a small number of asylum seekers who arrive via small boats to France.</p> <p>Cooper said the first returns would begin “later this month”, as the first detentions of asylum seekers on small boats took place the day after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/04/uk-to-start-small-boats-returns-france-within-days-after-eu-gives-green-light\">deal was ratified in August</a>. Although this is a pilot scheme, ministers hope they can continue to develop and expand it.</p> <h2>Why is there a crackdown on foreign students?</h2>  <p>Tens of thousands of foreign students have been contacted by the Home Office to say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/02/home-office-tells-foreign-students-they-will-be-removed-if-they-overstay-visas\">they will be deported if they overstay their visas</a>.

                  "After a summer recess dominated by headlines about Reform UK’s hardline immigration proposals and protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, the home secretary returned to parliament seeking to wrest back control of the narrative.\nYvette Cooper has announced a flurry of tough asylum measures including suspending refugee family reunion applications, and even floated the idea that refugees could be moved out of hotels and into warehouses instead.\nShe promised MPs that ministers were doing their bit to help those fleeing persecution, in “the British way”. But will ministers be caught between its promises of compassion and tough talk of migration?\nThe government has temporarily suspended new refugee family reunion applications as ministers want to prove that refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions “as everyone else”.\nPeople who have had their asylum claims accepted will now have to apply through the standard family scheme that applies to UK citizens, who are required to show that they have a joint income of at least £29,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.\nCooper said changes will be made to the family reunion routes process, and will eventually become law in spring.\nCampaigners have warned this is one of the only safe, legal routes available for refugees fleeing persecution or war to be reunited with their partner or child. Some MPs have highlighted remarks Cooper made four years ago, when she said: “If there are not safe, legal routes for family reunion we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous criminal gangs.”\nThe government has vowed to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029. At least 32,000 asylum seekers currently occupy them at a huge cost to the taxpayer. Ministers say they will need to be closed “as swiftly as possible” but in “an orderly and sustainable manner”. Government insiders say they expect five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close by the end of the year, with more to follow in the new year.\nAs of Monday, single adults who are granted asylum will be given 28 days to move out of their temporary housing. Ministers have reduced the existing 56-day timeframe to help reduce the number of people staying in hotels. But it could push more asylum seekers on to the streets.\nCooper went further on Tuesday after her measures dominated the front pages. She suggested asylum seekers could be housed in warehouses. The prime minister’s spokesperson said the government was indeed looking at “using modular buildings on industrial sites, ex-military sites”. A timeline has not been outlined for this.\nJudges will no longer have power to hear appeals made by asylum seekers. Instead, the government has set up a new independent body “staffed by professionally trained adjudicators” to ensure high standards. It is hoped that this will operate in a similar way to the magistrates system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts. Ministers hope this will speed up the process of asylum appeals.\nMinisters have been referring to the UK-France agreement as a great example of how the government is taking action to “smash the gangs” by returning a small number of asylum seekers who arrive via small boats to France.\nCooper said the first returns would begin “later this month”, as the first detentions of asylum seekers on small boats took place the day after the deal was ratified in August. Although this is a pilot scheme, ministers hope they can continue to develop and expand it.\nTens of thousands of foreign students have been contacted by the Home Office to say they will be deported if they overstay their visas. The government launched the campaign in hope of cutting the numbers of students making asylum claims. In the year to June 2025, 431,725 visas were granted to foreign students who had come to the UK to study.\nThe government wants to press ahead with these tough measures to take on Reform UK. Starmer told his cabinet ministers that migration is a “central issue” to his government and he understands the “frustration people feel at the level of illegal crossings and the sight of asylum hotels in their communities”.\nDespite ministers’ tough talk, the Conservatives immediately said Starmer “doesn’t have the stomach” to take stronger action. Farage did not directly respond to the measures, but the fact that the prime minister had to spend a lot of his media round on Monday attacking Farage spoke volumes.\nLabour MPs and refugee charities have swiftly criticised the measures, particuarly the suspension of the refugee family reunion process. The government has been accused of pushing children “into the arms of people smugglers”.",

A landslide. Out with the old, easy-does-it, Lib Dem-adjacent gradualism of previous Green leaders. In with a more radical, leftist eco-populism.</p> <p>Zack was all smiles.

                  "Zack Polanski has won the election to lead the Green party in England and Wales, with an overwhelming mandate for the party to adopt his vision to become a mass membership “eco-populism” movement directly taking on Reform UK.\nPolanski, who was the party’s deputy leader and is a Green member of the London assembly, defeated Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns by 20,411 to 3,705 votes in a ballot of party members. Ramsay and Chowns, who were standing as a co-leadership team, are two of the Greens’ four MPs.\nPolanski took nearly 85% of the votes on a turnout of just over 37%, notably higher than the 22% seen when the post was last contested in 2021.\nSpeaking to a cheering crowd in London, the new leader promised to take on Reform and Labour, saying the Greens’ moment had come.\n“This is the Green party’s time. People in this country are exhausted. They are tired, they are sick of working long hours, and never feeling secure,” he said.\n“We know this political space has been ripe for charlatans like Nigel Farage and Reform millionaires who are pretending to serve working-class communities but are actually backed by the same billionaires who are destroying our democracies, our communities and our planet. So it is an absolute moral responsibility in this moment for the Green party to step up with the bold politics.”\nOn Starmer, he said: “My message to Labour is very clear: we are not here to be disappointed by you. We are not here to be concerned by you. We are here to replace you.”\nSaying he wanted the Greens to aim for more than 30 seats at the next election, Polanski said he would not prop up a new Starmer government, adding: “I cannot imagine any scenario in which I would want to work with Keir Starmer.”\nWhile a Polanski win had been increasingly expected by party insiders, the result – with Ramsay and Chowns winning only 5% of the possible votes from an electorate of just over 64,500 – was particularly emphatic.\nIt heralds what could be a markedly new chapter for the party, abandoning its longstanding focus on building up councillor and MP numbers in favour of a more radical, media-focused approach.\nWhile Polanski has said he will still concentrate on electoral gains, his hope is to accelerate Green advances by adopting a more visible and sometimes combative tone in media appearances, with the hope of mimicking Reform’s rapid advances under Nigel Farage.\nAnswering media questions after his victory speech, Polanski said the success of Farage in getting his message across to voters was “throwing down the gauntlet” to other parties: “It’s time to be really ambitious, and to be visionary … Let’s raise our communications game. Let’s raise the boldness of our messaging.”\nRamsay and Chowns previously said while they acknowledged Polanski’s communication skills – he is a former actor – they were concerned his more overtly leftwing approach could put off moderate voters, especially in the sort of rural seats they represent in parliament.\nAsked whether he would cooperate with the new leftwing party being launched by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, Polanski said it was too early to talk about alliances, and also a matter for the wider party. It was better, he said, to think of “intellectual coalitions”.\nHe said he had talked to Corbyn about an inquiry into the situation in Gaza proposed by the former Labour leader: “We don’t need to be in the same party for me to support that. We don’t even need to be ‘allies’ for me to support that. What I see is a politician who is doing strong, principled work that aligns with the things I care about and the party cares about, and I think that’s different.”\nCorbyn congratulated Polanski in a post on X, saying: “I look forward to working with you to create a fairer, kinder world.”\nEllie Reeves, the Labour chair, also congratulated him but said the new Green leader “must level with the British people” about whether he backed continued Nato membership, after he said during the campaign that Donald Trump’s approach made this unfeasible.\nAfter a sometimes bruising campaign, Polanski paid tribute to all the party’s MPs, particularly Ramsay, who was first elected as a councillor two decades ago.\nHe ended his speech with an appeal for voters enthused by his message to sign up: “If you’re feeling hopeless, if you’re feeling in despair, if you’re feeling politically homeless, there is a political home for you.\n“I promise you nothing will make you feel more inspired, more ready to get out there, and more like we can turn our country around than joining the Green party.

This is Keir saying he wants to have a direct line of sight to everything. Darren knows the departments inside out because of the spending review,” one said.</p> <p>“Keir has been thinking about how to fix things for the last couple of months and these are his appointments and this is his structure. There are decisions that were made in the Treasury – winter fuel being one of them – where No 10 did not take enough oversight.”</p> <p>Another senior No 10 source said: “These are not people who have been appointed to be at odds with the Treasury or alternative power bases but to work with it. The economic agenda has to be aligned. But of course the PM needs to be able to shape it. Downing Street has to be able to challenge.”</p> <p>A senior government insider denied the changes risked undermining Reeves’s position, saying she had been involved in discussions on them since earlier in the summer. “That is an analysis based on prime ministers and chancellors of the past – Blair and Brown, May and Hammond – when in fact these appointments make the Treasury’s job easier,” they said.</p> <p>Jones, whose new title will be chief secretary to the prime minster, will be replaced as Rachel Reeves’s deputy by James Murray, who has been promoted from exchequer secretary. In turn, his role will be taken by Dan Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to reward the new 2024 intake.</p> <p>However, there is not expected to be a wider reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks this week, senior sources said, and cabinet ministers will stay in their current roles.</p> <p>The communications operation will also be shaken up with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.</p> <p>His appointment has caused some alarm in government, as he did some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/16/russia.media?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">work for Russian president Vladimir Putin </a>in the early noughties to reshape his own image in the eyes of the west ahead of hosting the G8 summit that year. “I can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government,” one Labour source said.</p> <p>The political role is separate from that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/25/ex-sun-editor-david-dinsmore-to-take-up-new-government-communications-role\">David Dinsmore</a>, a former editor of the Sun who has been tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. There have been questions internally over whether either man is up to speed with the modern media landscape.</p> <p>James Lyons, Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down. Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. Joe Dancey, the Labour party’s director of policy and communications, and partner of the health secretary Wes Streeting, has also left his role.</p> <p>The No 10 policy unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.</p> <p>Stuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s priorities were taken into account in every decision.</p> <p>A new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.</p> <p>However, there was some concern among Labour MPs that the changes may not fix fundamental problems at the top of government. The latest appointments mean that since Starmer became Labour leader, he has had four chiefs of staff and five directors of communications.</p> <p>One Labour backbencher said: “Overall I think it is not something you can staff your way out of. This is about the politics and the story we tell. All the comms and strategy people in the world won’t fix that.”</p> <p>A senior Labour source added: “It’s not just a question of narrative. It’s ‘what is our purpose and how do we use power?’ The stakes are a shift to radical right authoritarian government. As progressives that’s an emergency.”</p> <p>In his BBC interview, Starmer said while he understood people’s concerns about migration, Reform and Nigel Farage were exploiting the issue. “They feed on grievance. They don’t want the problem solved because they’ve got no reason to exist if the problems are solved,” he said.</p> <p>When asked about a recent spate of English flags being draped on lamp-posts or spray-painted on roundabouts, the prime minister said he was proud of the flag, and had one in his Downing Street flat, but was wary of it being used for “divisive” reasons.</p> <p>Mujtaba Rahman, of political analysts Eurasia Group, said: “Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Downing Street team reflects his frustration at what he sees as a bloated but slow civil service machine and a desire to bolster No 10’s heft on the economy.</p> <p>“That is a belated recognition that Starmer delegated too much power to Rachel Reeves, whose political judgment was lacking on means-testing the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts – both later abandoned.”</p>",

In turn, his role will be taken by Dan Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to reward the new 2024 intake.\nHowever, there is not expected to be a wider reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks this week, senior sources said, and cabinet ministers will stay in their current roles.\nThe communications operation will also be shaken up with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.\nHis appointment has caused some alarm in government, as he did some work for Russian president Vladimir Putin in the early noughties to reshape his own image in the eyes of the west ahead of hosting the G8 summit that year. “I can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government,” one Labour source said.\nThe political role is separate from that of David Dinsmore, a former editor of the Sun who has been tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. There have been questions internally over whether either man is up to speed with the modern media landscape.\nJames Lyons, Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down. Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. Joe Dancey, the Labour party’s director of policy and communications, and partner of the health secretary Wes Streeting, has also left his role.\nThe No 10 policy unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.\nStuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s priorities were taken into account in every decision.\nA new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.\nHowever, there was some concern among Labour MPs that the changes may not fix fundamental problems at the top of government. The latest appointments mean that since Starmer became Labour leader, he has had four chiefs of staff and five directors of communications.\nOne Labour backbencher said: “Overall I think it is not something you can staff your way out of. This is about the politics and the story we tell. All the comms and strategy people in the world won’t fix that.”\nA senior Labour source added: “It’s not just a question of narrative. It’s ‘what is our purpose and how do we use power?’ The stakes are a shift to radical right authoritarian government. As progressives that’s an emergency.”\nIn his BBC interview, Starmer said while he understood people’s concerns about migration, Reform and Nigel Farage were exploiting the issue. “They feed on grievance. They don’t want the problem solved because they’ve got no reason to exist if the problems are solved,” he said.\nWhen asked about a recent spate of English flags being draped on lamp-posts or spray-painted on roundabouts, the prime minister said he was proud of the flag, and had one in his Downing Street flat, but was wary of it being used for “divisive” reasons.\nMujtaba Rahman, of political analysts Eurasia Group, said: “Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Downing Street team reflects his frustration at what he sees as a bloated but slow civil service machine and a desire to bolster No 10’s heft on the economy.\n“That is a belated recognition that Starmer delegated too much power to Rachel Reeves, whose political judgment was lacking on means-testing the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts – both later abandoned.”",

                  "<p>A reshuffle on the Monday morning before parliament returned from recess had been long rumoured, but many in Westminster had expected a shake-up of junior ministers rather than Downing Street.</p> <p>Staff in No 10 were gathered in awkward silence at 9.30am in the Pillared Room to wait for the prime minister to explain the changes, many of whom had thus far only read about them online.</p> <p>The departures and new hires are expected to signal a new understanding about the need for experienced hands in government and to give Keir Starmer more direct oversight over the delivery of key government priorities, especially on the economy.</p> <p>But some of the hires – particularly those from the Tony Blair era – have already proved controversial.</p>  <h2>Who’s in?</h2>  <h2>Darren Jones</h2>    <p>Starmer has poached Jones, in effect Rachel Reeves’s deputy, for the newly created post of chief secretary to the prime minister. A reliable communicator and a willing attack dog, Jones is expected to do lots of media for the PM on the government’s message and delivery, and to take on the threat from Reform. </p> <p>Regarded as hardline on the economy, Jones was Reeves’s firewall in tense negotiations with cabinet ministers over the spending review. But he is also a loud progressive, having called for Labour to be the party of “love, compassion and community” to face off against Nigel Farage’s politics of “anger, division and blame”.</p> <p>Chief secretary to the prime minister </p> <p></p> <h2>Tim Allan</h2>  <p>The most controversial appointment of the shake-up, Allan is a veteran spinner from the Blair government and the founder of the PR mega-agency Portland. </p> <p>An extremely experienced communications specialist, his appointment is part of what one senior staffer told colleagues was more “grownups” returning to government – although that description has raised hackles internally. </p> <p>Some special advisers are very concerned about Portland’s previous links to lobbying for the governments of Kazakhstan, Russia and Qatar – including for the controversial 2022 World Cup – and believe it will be a major issue for the government.

                  "A reshuffle on the Monday morning before parliament returned from recess had been long rumoured, but many in Westminster had expected a shake-up of junior ministers rather than Downing Street.\nStaff in No 10 were gathered in awkward silence at 9.30am in the Pillared Room to wait for the prime minister to explain the changes, many of whom had thus far only read about them online.\nThe departures and new hires are expected to signal a new understanding about the need for experienced hands in government and to give Keir Starmer more direct oversight over the delivery of key government priorities, especially on the economy.\nBut some of the hires – particularly those from the Tony Blair era – have already proved controversial.\nStarmer has poached Jones, in effect Rachel Reeves’s deputy, for the newly created post of chief secretary to the prime minister. A reliable communicator and a willing attack dog, Jones is expected to do lots of media for the PM on the government’s message and delivery, and to take on the threat from Reform. \nRegarded as hardline on the economy, Jones was Reeves’s firewall in tense negotiations with cabinet ministers over the spending review. But he is also a loud progressive, having called for Labour to be the party of “love, compassion and community” to face off against Nigel Farage’s politics of “anger, division and blame”.\nChief secretary to the prime minister \n\nThe most controversial appointment of the shake-up, Allan is a veteran spinner from the Blair government and the founder of the PR mega-agency Portland. \nAn extremely experienced communications specialist, his appointment is part of what one senior staffer told colleagues was more “grownups” returning to government – although that description has raised hackles internally. \nSome special advisers are very concerned about Portland’s previous links to lobbying for the governments of Kazakhstan, Russia and Qatar – including for the controversial 2022 World Cup – and believe it will be a major issue for the government. Allan left the firm in 2019. Portland stopped lobbying on behalf of Russia in 2014.\nMost of Allan’s past colleagues describe him as charming and collegiate. He will be well on the right of the party. The journalist Steve Richards recalled Allan’s No 10 leaving do 20 years ago where Blair teased that he was “even more rightwing than me”.\nExecutive director of communications\n\nSaid to have been Starmer’s choice for cabinet secretary, the former Bank of England deputy governor has finally been lured to Downing Street to add much-needed economic heft to the operation. \nShafik had a controversial tenure at Columbia University over pro-Gaza protests that eventually forced her resignation, but in No 10 she will be back in her specialism and she has held a major Whitehall role before as permanent secretary at the Department for International Development. \nAlong with Jones and Starmer’s new private secretary, Daniel York-Smith, who comes from the Treasury, Shafik’s appointment signals Starmer is clearly tooling up for big battles to come on the economy.\nChief economic adviser\n\nMcSweeney remains the most powerful member of the prime minister’s inner circle, his most trusted adviser and the man he credits for the sweeping election victory.

                  "<p>Good morning. Parliament has returned from its summer recess. MPs are filing back into those hallowed halls to resume the business of running the country. Have you missed them? Judging by polling on <a href=\"https://natcen.ac.uk/low-trust-governments-drives-growing-demand-electoral-reform\">trust in politicians</a>, the answer from many of you is likely a resounding no.</p> <p>For most MPs, the summer recess is a chance to pause and reset. Not so for Reform UK. The insurgent party, which has just four MPs, spent the summer working the country like it was in the middle of a general election campaign. It has been hard to escape Nigel Farage (pictured top) and Reform: the party has held at least five press conferences since recess began (with another scheduled for today). There has also been a flurry of statements and open letters, and record-breaking polling to top it all off. Reform returns to parliament riding high.</p> <p>The ball is now in Labour’s court. With a packed autumn schedule, the government has an opportunity to reset the news cycle and seize the political agenda. But, just because it can, does not mean that it will.</p> <p>Labour has been widely criticised for failing to articulate a message that cuts through in its first year in power. Can that change this autumn? What challenges lie ahead and where might the party finally break through? To explore all this and more, I spoke to the Guardian’s political editor, <em><strong>Pippa Crerar</strong></em>. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Afghanistan</strong></em> | At least 250 people were dead and hundreds more injured in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/afghanistan-earthquake-near-jalalabad-magnitude-6-quake-pakistan-border\">a magnitude 6 earthquake</a> that struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. The quake was centred 27km north-east of the city of Jalalabad.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Israel-Gaza war </strong></em>| Israeli airstrikes and gunfire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/31/israeli-airstrikes-gunfire-gaza-city\">killed at least 18 people</a> in and around Gaza City, local health authorities said, as Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet prepared to discuss plans to seize the city.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Conservatives </strong></em>| Doubts have surfaced over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/doubts-cast-on-kemi-badenochs-claim-of-us-medical-school-offer\">Kemi Badenoch’s claim</a> to have been offered a place at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to recall the proposal and the university not providing the course.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news </strong></em>| A police officer was allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/31/police-officer-allegedly-punched-in-face-and-four-arrests-made-at-london-anti-asylum-protest\">punched in the face</a> and four people were arrested at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Heart disease </strong></em>| Doctors have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel\">a drug that is better than aspirin</a> at preventing heart attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines worldwide.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘Ultimately, the buck stops with the person at the top’</h2>    <p>Labour did not head into summer recess from a position of strength. The party was forced into a humiliating retreat over its welfare reform bill after a dramatic backbench rebellion. After weeks of bruising infighting, many in Labour felt the summer break offered a chance to cool tempers and rethink. They may come to regret that.</p> <p>“They could have managed to allow everyone a break without vacating the public arena for Reform and they may rue the day that they allowed Reform to set the agenda,” Pippa Crerar told me. “It makes it harder now to refute the claims that they don’t have a grip on migration and it means that they have to think quite carefully about how to get back on to the front foot.”</p> <p>Still, the Labour government is determined to wrest back control, and they will have plenty of opportunity to do so: with a packed autumn of domestic challenges and international crises, the public will be looking to hear directly from those in power.</p> <p>“Whether they managed to get the positive message that they want to get across is a totally different question and obviously a much harder feat. People I’ve spoken to in Downing Street and in government suggest that they understand they need to do that, and there’s a degree of frustration that delivery’s not fast enough and the messaging isn’t coherent enough,” Pippa said.</p> <p>There has been a flurry of reports that Keir Starmer (pictured above) is preparing a minor reshuffle of his government, alongside changes to his Downing Street team.</p> <p>“Ultimately, the buck stops with the person at the top,” Pippa said. “And if the person at the top isn’t able to articulate why they want to be in government and what they want to achieve in a way that resonates with ordinary people, it’s a struggle.”</p> <p>So what problems lie ahead for the government, at home and on the international stage? </p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The domestic challenges …</strong></p> <p>Recent polling makes for an uncomfortable read for Labour supporters. The party enjoyed little in the way of a honeymoon period, with figures showing its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/31/labours-poll-ratings-drop-is-starmer-future-in-question\">ratings have fallen further</a> in the first 10 months of government than those of any other party in modern history.</p> <p>But Pippa told me that the polling, which has been brutal for the Conservatives as well, shows widespread discontent with mainstream politics generally.</p> <p>“Reform is doing so well because it capitalises on that discontent, it becomes a vehicle for the disillusionment which many people have in the mainstream political parties,” Pippa said. “And Farage is an extraordinary communicator who manages to tap into people’s fears, just as he did with Brexit, to provide answers that I would argue exacerbates them, particularly with migration.”</p> <p>On migration, Labour are breathing a sigh of relief to have won an appeal to continue using hotels to house asylums seekers, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/29/labour-won-the-legal-battle-over-asylum-hotels-but-the-right-is-running-the-story\">fight is far from over</a>. The party are working to reduce the asylum backlog, having announced their agreement of a one in, one out deal with the French, but it’s slow work, Pippa explained. For MPs in marginal seats, particularly around the “red wall”, they fear migration is the issue that could cost them unless the government is tougher.</p> <p>The European convention on human rights (ECHR) is the new battleground, with Farage describing it as such. “Downing Street has made it absolutely clear that the UK was not going to leave the ECHR, because it would be hugely problematic for things like trade deals and, crucially, the Good Friday agreement,” Pippa said. But the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jun/18/shabana-mahmood-says-uk-will-seek-reform-of-human-rights-convention\">announced a review</a> of article 8 (respect for your private and family life) of the EHRC and possibly article 3 (protecting you from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), as there are arguments that their scope is too wide and they are preventing the deportation of convicted foreign criminals.</p> <p>There’s a broader debate on whether the UK should work with European Union member states on more general reforms of the ECHR as a whole.</p> <p>The other big domestic challenge is the economy. “Rachel Reeves is ending the summer in a worse position than she started,” Pippa said, with inflation remaining high, many still struggling with the cost of living crisis, and the Office for Budget Responsibility<strong> </strong>now thinking of revising its forecast in light of an outdated measure of productivity.</p> <p>“The problem it creates for Reeves, and the reason I think we are likely to see the budget potentially pushed back into November from October, is that they’re trying to work out the communications on it. They have boxed themselves in. They said that they are not going to borrow any more and they said that they don’t want to be a government that cuts spending. Well, that only leaves them with tax rises,” Pippa said.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>… And the international upheavals</strong></p> <p>The problem for Starmer is that his international popularity isn’t translating much domestically. But why is his reputation better among international audiences? Pippa told me Starmer<strong> </strong>has built a reputation for being effective in difficult situations with international partners.</p> <p>“The big international moment coming up in the next month is Donald Trump’s state visit. And, as we saw when Trump was on a holiday in Scotland, he has this capacity to whirl into town and stir everything up and then disappear again. He’s a very unpredictable president,” Pippa said.</p> <p>Despite Trump’s promises to end the war in Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin has continued ordering attacks (including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/28/uk-summons-russian-ambassador-over-british-council-missile-damage-in-kyiv\">a deadly assault on Kyiv</a> last week). And the Alaska summit didn’t deliver what Ukraine and its European partners wanted, Pippa said.</p> <p>On Gaza, Starmer has promised to recognise Palestine as a state, after being urged to do so by his cabinet and the wider Labour movement. But as the<strong> </strong>devastation continues in Gaza and the siege is tightened across the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories, pressure grows on Starmer to go further, with growing calls for further sanctions.</p> <p>“They’ve already sanctioned the two far right members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet. We could well see more to come,” Pippa said. “The government has certainly indicated that they would be prepared to take further steps and sanction not only just politicians but also senior Israeli military, if they think that they’ve been directly responsible for some of their atrocities in Gaza.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>An existential moment for Keir Starmer</strong></p> <p>Starmer clearly drew out the battle line when he labelled Reform as the main opposition to his government. But over the last few months there has been a real risk of Starmer being defined by Farage. So how will Labour respond?</p> <p>“The big danger is that personal attacks on Farage put the spotlight on him and give him a platform. By defining him as the opposition, it cuts the Tories off at the knees, but it also risks putting Reform UK in a better position,” Pippa said. “If the government sees Reform as a potential government in waiting, then presumably the public may as well.”</p> <p>And we saw this summer what happens when Farage is left unchallenged. “They will take the fight to him.,” Pippa said of Labour. But whether they do that by moving in to Reform UK’s terrain, or by managing to make the case for their own agenda based on Labour values and on what Starmer believes in will be the interesting thing to watch, she added.</p> <p>The problem for voters is that many just don’t know what the PM stands for. “Starmer has struggled to articulate what he believes in, so this is an existential moment if they can’t turn the tide away from Reform UK and can’t convince people that Labour can actually deliver,” Pippa said, pointing to next May’s local elections, as well as votes in Wales and Scotland, as critical moments. And, by next summer, Labour will be halfway through its parliamentary term.</p> <p>But, Pippa added, Reform’s lead in the polls does not make an election win a foregone conclusion, and Labour still have time on their side. She described Reform’s policies as vague and contradictory. While Farage has been able to capitalise on exploiting social and racial divisions, many British people may not feel comfortable with the direction he represents.</p> <p>“We live in incredibly volatile times,” Pippa said, “But it does definitely still feel like there’s everything to play for for Labour”.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Unfortunate enough to have heard about the “<strong>performative male</strong>”, the internet’s new least favourite type of guy?

                  "Good morning. Parliament has returned from its summer recess. MPs are filing back into those hallowed halls to resume the business of running the country. Have you missed them? Judging by polling on trust in politicians, the answer from many of you is likely a resounding no.\nFor most MPs, the summer recess is a chance to pause and reset. Not so for Reform UK.

By defining him as the opposition, it cuts the Tories off at the knees, but it also risks putting Reform UK in a better position,” Pippa said. “If the government sees Reform as a potential government in waiting, then presumably the public may as well.”\nAnd we saw this summer what happens when Farage is left unchallenged. “They will take the fight to him.,” Pippa said of Labour. But whether they do that by moving in to Reform UK’s terrain, or by managing to make the case for their own agenda based on Labour values and on what Starmer believes in will be the interesting thing to watch, she added.\nThe problem for voters is that many just don’t know what the PM stands for. “Starmer has struggled to articulate what he believes in, so this is an existential moment if they can’t turn the tide away from Reform UK and can’t convince people that Labour can actually deliver,” Pippa said, pointing to next May’s local elections, as well as votes in Wales and Scotland, as critical moments. And, by next summer, Labour will be halfway through its parliamentary term.\nBut, Pippa added, Reform’s lead in the polls does not make an election win a foregone conclusion, and Labour still have time on their side. She described Reform’s policies as vague and contradictory. While Farage has been able to capitalise on exploiting social and racial divisions, many British people may not feel comfortable with the direction he represents.\n“We live in incredibly volatile times,” Pippa said, “But it does definitely still feel like there’s everything to play for for Labour”.\nUnfortunate enough to have heard about the “performative male”, the internet’s new least favourite type of guy?

Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world’s biggest fossil fuel producer appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/21/us-and-india-lead-g20-on-climate-action-report-says\">intent on undermining hard-won progress</a> on reducing emissions.</p> <p>The most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/08/texas-floods-republicans-response-trump\">National Weather Service</a>, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/feb/16/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-fema-rebuild\">the devastation in North Carolina</a> caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding.</p> <p>Then there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/19/climate-misinformation-turning-crisis-into-catastrophe-ipie-report\">false claims</a> that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain.</p> <p>Most alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/19/case-closed-999-of-scientists-agree-climate-emergency-caused-by-humans\">supported by 99.9% of specialists</a>, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/14/survival-of-the-richest-trump-climate-and-the-logic-of-the-doomsday-bunker\">prepare their doomsday bunkers</a>.</p> <p>There also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible.</p> <p>The Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/21/trump-scientific-research-climate\">defunding world-leading climate research agencies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/29/trump-fires-climate-report-contributors\">firing droves of scientists</a> and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/national-climate-assessment-published\">published the US National Climate Report</a> in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Worse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-drill-baby-drill-tariffs\">a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change.</p> <p>The Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/15/tories-reform-net-zero-climate-science\">break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns</a>, despite the very strong public support for both.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/15/farage-and-truss-attend-uk-launch-of-us-climate-denial-group-heartland\">attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe</a> which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/22/us-thinktank-climate-science-deniers-working-with-rightwingers-in-eu-parliament-heartland-institute\">has been wooing far-right European politicians</a> since at least February 2023.</p> <p>In these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/10/world-crisis-end-globalisation-mistake-lula-da-silva\">leaders still seeking global solutions</a>, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-polluters\">Polluters series</a> to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/06/down-to-earth-global-solidarity-levies-task-force\">radical climate solutions</a>, and the campaigns that remind us that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-89-percent-project\">the overwhelming majority of people</a> in the world want more ambitious climate action.</p> <p>We are not alone.

In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding.\nThen there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain.\nMost alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their doomsday bunkers.\nThere also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible.\nThe Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.\nWorse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change.\nThe Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both.\nEarlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European politicians since at least February 2023.\nIn these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action.\nWe are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us. But we need to stick together and keep focusing on real stories, real problems and real people.\nOur reporters are dedicated to exposing the forces working to undermine environmental progress and protections.

It has also lost in excess of £5m in expected advertiser revenue.</p> \n<p>Warner, who has led the outlet since 2019, said his title’s growth had been accompanied by an enthusiasm from brands to embrace LGBTQ+ audiences. He blames an anti-DEI drive in the US for the dramatic shift.</p> \n<p>“I know that media and marketing is also going through a challenging year anyway, but when we’re thinking about other organisations that don’t talk to diverse themes, they’re not nearly as impacted as we are,” he said. “This is just good old-fashioned discrimination. Because discrimination doesn’t have to make business sense. Discrimination doesn’t have to be logical. Discrimination is discrimination.</p> \n<p>“We’re really experiencing the impact of what happens when voices that are pressuring organisations to give in to less inclusive perspectives start winning. Then it creates this massive behavioural shift in brands and organisations.”</p> \n<p>Nafisa Bakkar, the co-founder of Amaliah, a publication aimed at “amplifying the voices of Muslim women”, said there had been a “change in mood” among brands and advertisers. “There was this DNI [diversity and inclusion] gold rush,” she said. “It is, I would say, well and truly over.</p> \n<p>“We work with a lot of UK advertisers, but I would say that the US has a lot more emphasis on what they would call ‘brand safety’, which I think is a code word for ‘we don’t want to rock the boat’. I would say there is a lot more focus on this element.”</p> \n<p>Ibrahim Kamara, the founder of the youth platform GUAP, which has a large black and ethnically diverse audience, said he had detected a “relative difference” from 2020 in approaches from brands.</p> \n<p>He and others cited the economic pressures on advertisers generally in recent years. However, he said the “hype and the PR around wanting to support and connect with diverse audiences” had also subsided.</p> \n<p>“The thing that most people within these kind of spaces can probably agree on is that the energy and the PR is very different now,” he said. “It was almost a badge of honour to be able to say that you’re supporting certain communities. Now, I’ve seen that lots of the diversity and inclusion people that were hired around that period have probably lost their jobs. It doesn’t have the same PR effect any more.”</p> \n<p>Warner said the anti-DEI impact pre-dated the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Figures such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/26/walmart-dei-conservatives-race-gender\">conservative pundit Robby Starbuck</a> have been engaged in a long-running anti-DEI campaign, pressuring firms to drop their diversity efforts. However, Warner said Trump’s arrival “gave everyone, I think, permission to be honest about it”.</p> \n<p>Not all publications in the sector have been hit in the same way as Gay Times. Companies with business models less reliant on US advertising, as well as some big players with long-established relationships, said they had managed to negotiate the changing political environment.</p> \n<p>“Brands are nervous, that’s for sure, or careful <strong>– </strong>or a combination of both,” said Darren Styles, the managing director of Stream Publishing, which publishes Attitude magazine. “They’re aware it can be a lightning rod for a vocal minority.

                  "<p>A former Labour justice secretary has warned that Reform UK will continue to rise in opinion polls unless the government moves faster to close hotels housing people seeking asylum.</p> <p>On Friday, the government won a court of appeal challenge against an injunction by Epping Forest district council that would have resulted in 130 asylum seekers being moved out of the Bell hotel. In recent weeks the hotel has become the focus of repeated protests, some of which have been orchestrated by far-right extremists and have turned violent.</p> <p>Despite the technical victory for the Home Office, as other local councils could have brought legal challenges against the use of hotels if the appeal had not been successful, ministers are braced for further legal battles.</p> <p>Charlie Falconer, who served as lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair, said the government was right to take the Epping case to the court of appeal but that people wanted action to close asylum hotels.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve obviously got to move forward in relation to closing the hotels and also stopping the crossings.</p> <p>“The government always has the burden of doing what’s possible and the government is doing the right thing in relation to it, but there’s a lot more to do, and if we don’t, as a government, do it, then you’ll see those opinion polls raised yet further for Reform, because they don’t have the burden of having to be practical.”</p> <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has consistently led in opinion polls since the spring, with the latest BMG poll for the i newspaper putting the party on 35%, 15 points ahead of Labour.</p> <p>Lord Falconer rejected suggestions that the UK might have to pull out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to be able to efficiently remove people with no right to be in the country, saying it would be damaging because it would mean “deporting people back into danger”.</p> <p>“It does not mean that you can do nothing. You’ve got to think of ways of deterring people from coming here. The obligation that we’ve got is not to deport into danger. That doesn’t mean that you can’t, for example, deport to third countries.”</p> <p>After the decision on Friday, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said: “We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day.”</p> <p>The Refugee Council’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said using hotels to house asylum seekers was “untenable”, adding: “Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option.

As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe.”</p> <p>The charity urged ministers to adopt its “one-off” scheme granting temporary permission to stay to those asylum seekers most likely to be recognised as refugees because of the situation in their home country. This would lead to the closure of hotels by next year, according to its own analysis.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, said: “Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities.”</p> <p>Starmer was not a party to the case, which concerned people seeking asylum – not illegal immigrants. The Home Office’s lawyer suggested the legal duty of the home secretary, as a government minister representing the whole of the UK, to uphold human rights trumped those of a single council to follow planning law. The judges said this analysis was “unattractive”.</p> <p>Badenoch added that the ruling was a “setback, but it is not the end. I say to Conservative councils seeking similar injunctions against asylum hotels – keep going”. But a senior Tory source said: “They’re human beings; they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?”</p> <p>Some Tory MPs fear urging councils to mount further legal challenges could backfire, given the court’s warning that local protests cannot justify emergency injunctions. Another Tory MP said: “We’re throwing lawyers at this problem instead of showing how exactly we can fix the system.”</p> <p>The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the decision, claiming the government had “used ECHR [European convention on human rights] against the people of Epping”. Despite the ruling relating to legal asylum seekers, he added: “Illegal migrants have more rights than the British people under Starmer.”</p> <p>Home Office lawyers had argued that the government’s duties towards asylum seekers under the ECHR were “fundamentally different” from Epping Forest district council’s planning responsibilities.</p> <p>The council’s leader, Chris Whitbread, called for calm, telling Times Radio: “There’s been peaceful protests and there’s been non-peaceful protests outside the hotel.”</p>    <p>After the court of appeal ruling, a small number of demonstrators carrying St George and union flags gathered outside the Bell hotel while police officers guarded its entrance.​</p> <p>One protester s​aid the decision could result in civil unrest. Carmen, who wore a pink top that said “Pink ladies say, the only way is Epping, send them home” on it, said: “We come every week – march, protest – and today’s ruling is just devastating, absolutely devastating. It will probably cause civil unrest.”</p> <p>The council could still be granted an injunction after the full hearing of the legal claim. Whitbread said: “Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still.”</p> <p>The judges said the original decision was “seriously flawed in principle”, and that the “risk of injustice to the residents of the hotel by being dispersed by 12 September when the trial of the claim was to take place only some six weeks later seems to have had oddly little resonance with the [high court] judge”.</p> <p>Neither the council nor the hotel’s owner had argued in the high court case that the fear of crime being committed in Epping in the future was a key factor, though both had agreed it was relevant.</p> <p>The court of appeal judges said this was correct, but that it was outweighed by the concern about incentivising more potentially violent protests, the upheaval of having to disperse more than 130 people for the short period before the trial, and other factors in the broader public interest.</p> <p>The judges granted the Home Office and the hotel’s owners permission to appeal. They also agreed Mr Justice Eyre was wrong to refuse to allow the home secretary to intervene in the case, saying the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues.</p>",

Whitbread said: “Obviously we’re still going to court in October to go for a final injunction and we will be pushing hard to make sure that’s successful, but we will do everything we can still.”\nThe judges said the original decision was “seriously flawed in principle”, and that the “risk of injustice to the residents of the hotel by being dispersed by 12 September when the trial of the claim was to take place only some six weeks later seems to have had oddly little resonance with the [high court] judge”.\nNeither the council nor the hotel’s owner had argued in the high court case that the fear of crime being committed in Epping in the future was a key factor, though both had agreed it was relevant.\nThe court of appeal judges said this was correct, but that it was outweighed by the concern about incentivising more potentially violent protests, the upheaval of having to disperse more than 130 people for the short period before the trial, and other factors in the broader public interest.\nThe judges granted the Home Office and the hotel’s owners permission to appeal. They also agreed Mr Justice Eyre was wrong to refuse to allow the home secretary to intervene in the case, saying the Home Office had a “constitutional role relating to public safety” and was affected by the issues.",

                  "<p>The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.merseyside.police.uk/police-forces/merseyside-police/areas/au/about-us/chief-officers/chief-constable-serena-kennedy-kpm/\">Serena Kennedy</a> retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge.</p> \n<p>She led its response to the Southport dance class murders last year, the riots that followed and led the way on giving ethnicity and nationality details of suspects, to counter disinformation.</p> \n<p>In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Kennedy said the riots in Southport started with “carloads” of people arriving to attack a mosque, and dismissed claims that asylum seekers were to blame for a crime wave.</p> \n<p>She also called for a new national scheme to counter violence, and criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot.</p> \n<p>Reform UK, which recently won local councils and is predicted to win more in elections next May, is vowing to scrap what it calls DEI initiatives – the term used by Donald Trump supporters – on diversity, equity and inclusion.</p> \n<p>Kennedy said: “I have a real nervousness that we are going backwards in relation to diversity and equality.”</p> \n<p>She said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/18/only-40-of-people-in-england-trust-their-police-force-research-reveals\">those groups with less confidence in policing</a> and other public services, such as ethnic minorities and women, needed efforts by key institutions such as the police to win their trust back.</p> \n<p>Kennedy said: “Is it acceptable for policing and the public sector to stop worrying about those people where there is a confidence gap and say, well that’s just tough, and we’ll let that confidence gap get even wider? … Absolutely not. That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.</p> \n<p>“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don’t.</p> \n<p>“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.</p> \n<p>“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy’s retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.</p> \n<p>She said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened:<strong> </strong>“Seeing the disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.</p> \n<p>“So I do think we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”</p> \n<p>The toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/23/southport-attacker-axel-rudakubana-jailed\">after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children</a>.</p> \n<p>The next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/19/rioters-after-southport-attack-largely-racially-motivated-thugs-met-chief-says\">riots that spread across the country</a> and were the worst in more than a decade.</p> \n<p>Kennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.</p> \n<p>The chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.</p> \n<p>She pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.</p> \n<p>Kennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”</p> \n<p>She said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/31/farage-accused-of-inciting-southport-violence-by-former-counter-terror-chief\">might be wrongly hiding key details from the public</a>. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”</p> \n<p>She dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                  "The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said.\nSerena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge.\nShe led its response to the Southport dance class murders last year, the riots that followed and led the way on giving ethnicity and nationality details of suspects, to counter disinformation.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Kennedy said the riots in Southport started with “carloads” of people arriving to attack a mosque, and dismissed claims that asylum seekers were to blame for a crime wave.\nShe also called for a new national scheme to counter violence, and criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot.\nReform UK, which recently won local councils and is predicted to win more in elections next May, is vowing to scrap what it calls DEI initiatives – the term used by Donald Trump supporters – on diversity, equity and inclusion.\nKennedy said: “I have a real nervousness that we are going backwards in relation to diversity and equality.”\nShe said those groups with less confidence in policing and other public services, such as ethnic minorities and women, needed efforts by key institutions such as the police to win their trust back.\nKennedy said: “Is it acceptable for policing and the public sector to stop worrying about those people where there is a confidence gap and say, well that’s just tough, and we’ll let that confidence gap get even wider? … Absolutely not. That’s why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.\n“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally’ – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don’t.\n“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.\n“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”\nKennedy’s retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.\nShe said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened: “Seeing the disorder that’s out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.\n“So I do think we’re on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”\nThe toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.\nThe next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by riots that spread across the country and were the worst in more than a decade.\nKennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”\nKennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.\nIn the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.\nThe chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.\nShe pointed to this May’s incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC’s Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.\nKennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we’d put out didn’t suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”\nShe said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authorities might be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn’t in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”\nKennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”\nShe dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I’m not seeing anything out of kilter … It’s just, it’s more newsworthy.”\n\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                  "<p>Good morning. Readers, I have a confession: like millions of romantics across the world, I am a Swiftie.</p> <p>The multiplatinum pop singer-songwriter speaks to me. It started when I was 16. Taylor Swift’s second studio album, Fearless, dropped in the UK in March 2009. That summer, much to my younger brother’s despair, I blasted Fifteen, Love Story, You Belong With Me and The Way I Loved You (the best song on the album – argue with the wall!) on repeat.</p> <p>I entered my 20s singing, badly, to 22 (and promptly stopped when a neighbour rightfully told me to shut up at 2am). I followed the ups and downs of her romantic entanglements, her REALLY cringey girl-gang era, watched in horror as she became a punchline and the target of mass contempt, and then smiled at her triumphant return during the pandemic with Folklore and Evermore. While I haven’t loved every album, and she’s been so prolific some have passed me by, I love that her music can transport me instantly back to being 15, 22, and now, gasp, 33.</p> <p>So yes, I was pleased to learn that American football superstar Travis Kelce and Swift, self-styled “your English teacher and your gym teacher”, announced their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/26/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged\">engagement</a> this week. The news broke the internet, prompting push notifications from major news organisations (including the Guardian), sparking the BBC to even launch a specific liveblog, and lit up group chats, including mine.</p> <p>Is that embarrassing and corny? Probably. But I like that despite her very public breakups, she kept singing about love, and kept believing in it (alright, I’ll stop now).</p> <p>How has she managed to remain this successful, this adored, for nearly two decades? Why does Swift have such a hold on several different generations? To dig into this very important question, I spoke to <em><strong>Dr Lucy Bennett</strong></em>, an academic at Cardiff University’s school of journalism, media and culture. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK news </strong></em>| The fertility rate for England and Wales has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/27/england-and-wales-fertility-rate-falls-for-third-consecutive-year\">fallen for the third year</a> in a row to reach a record low, figures show. Last year’s total fertility rate of 1.41 was the lowest since comparable data was first collected in 1938.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Gaza </strong></em>| Children under 15 years old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/children-make-up-third-of-outpatients-in-msf-hospitals-in-gaza-statistics-show\">made up almost a third of outpatients </a>treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last year, statistics published in the Lancet reveal.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US news </strong></em>| Two children were killed and 17 injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/minneapolis-active-shooter-school\">Minneapolis</a> on Wednesday.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>ChatGPT </strong></em>| Open AI is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-scrutiny-family-teen-killed-himself-sue-open-ai\">changing the way it responds to users</a> who show emotional distress after legal action from the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who killed himself after months of conversations with the chatbot.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Ukraine</strong></em>| Russian strikes killed at least four people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/28/russia-launches-kyiv-attack-ukraine-capital-deaths-injuries\">wounded at least 24 others</a>, city officials said on Thursday morning. Casualty numbers were expected to rise.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: Songs that resonate</h2>    <p>Taylor Swift is quite possibly the most successful pop artist of her generation. She has reached this position, and a net worth of $1.6bn, thanks in large part to her devoted fans, who range from “oldies” like me to Gen Alpha tweens.</p> <p>But how has she been able to connect to girls and women of all ages? Dr Lucy Bennett told me it’s down to her impressive lyricism. “I think that Swift resonates so strongly with women across generations because her songwriting often captures universal experiences, such as love, heartbreak, friendship, and self discovery, in a way that feels both deeply personal and widely relatable.”</p> <p>Bennett added that many women, like myself, feel as though we have grown up alongside her. Our own personal milestones – first love, first heartbreak, moving out, being thrust from our childhood bedrooms into the adult world and the identity crisis we all seem to go through before turning 30 – seem to echo through her songs.</p> <p>“At the same time, her openness about vulnerability and resilience, and her willingness to challenge cultural double standards against women, makes her a powerful figure of identification not just for younger fans but also for older generations who recognise their own stories in her work,” Bennett said.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Swift and her fans</strong></p> <p>Swift’s relationship with her fans can be intense, with some corners of the so-called “Swiftie fandom” veering into <a href=\"https://medium.com/@chimoge.9/unpacking-toxic-fandom-the-dark-side-of-swifties-loyalty-03e70f8c7463\">toxicity</a>.</p> <p>Bennett described it as one of deep connection, pointing to Swift’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/dec/09/taylor-swifts-eras-tour-smashes-touring-revenue-record-with-more-than-2bn-in-ticket-sales\">record-breaking</a> Eras Tour, which “worked so well to enhance these connections, being particularly meaningful in the way it shifts through time, through Swift’s different personal situations, also allowing fans then to reflect on their own stories and experiences.”</p> <p>The announcement of her engagement sparked a flood of videos of fans weeping on camera. Many said it felt as though a close friend had just announced they were getting married.</p> <p>“I think Swift inspires such intense feelings in her fans due to the connection that people have with her and her music. Many have grown up with her, linking the music to their specific memories and different things they have gone through in life, and so feel an emotional bond with her,” Bennett said.</p> <p>For many fans, this is a parasocial relationship – where one person feels a sense of intimacy with someone they’ve never actually met. Which is, advantageously, a good way to build an empire.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A savvy businesswoman</strong></p> <p>Swift is a savvy businesswoman who has been successful largely in her ability to leverage personal life stories into these juggernauts of financially lucrative events.</p> <p>“The engagement has been announced in the lead up to the new album, so the focus and media frenzy around this may work to promote the album even further... In this way, her private life becomes not only a source of artistic inspiration but also a powerful driver of wider cultural conversation and commercial success,” Bennett said.</p> <p>This is perhaps what makes Swift stand out from her contemporaries. When she released her first album in the mid 2000s, she utilised Myspace heavily to tease out clues of her next move, jumping on Tumblr, X, and now YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p> <p>“One of the things that makes Swift stand out compared to other pop stars is her intricate use of Easter eggs and coded messages for fans to decipher. While other artists have adopted similar practices, Swift has strongly elevated it, embedding hidden meanings, symbols, and narrative threads across her albums, videos and social media,” Bennet said.</p> <p>“This invites a kind of forensic engagement from fans, who search for clues in even the smallest details. The result is not just passive listening but an active, almost collaborative relationship, where fans feel drawn deeper into her world through the thrill of solving something.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Singing into the sunset</strong></p> <p>Swift has released so much music over the past two decades – 11 original studio albums and counting – that fans who have connected with heartbreak and triumph always seem to have something new to return to. </p> <p>But will her engagement, and what many hope will be a blissful marital happily ever after, change her relationship with fans? Bennett doesn’t think so.</p> <p>“For some fans they may now feel even more invested in her future. The announcement provoked such an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/26/taylor-swift-engaged-travis-kelce-reaction\">emotional response</a> from some, and this is because we have lived the rollercoaster of her love life alongside her. For some, they feel a core part of her journey due to her music being so deeply personal. We have her songs about the heartbreaks, the disappointments in love, with many fans then using the music to reflect on their own situations,” Bennet told me.</p> <p>While some are worried her songs won’t have the same emotional intensity if she’s not singing about heartbreak, Bennet added that for many, this announcement is “the culmination of a journey they’ve been part of.”</p> <p>Either way, as Swift once sang, “long live all the magic we made”.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>A beautiful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/27/my-favourite-childhood-outfit-dads-suede-jacket\">piece</a> from Amy Fleming about <strong>repurposing</strong> her dad’s old clothes, which also struck me as also a lament on time passing, and how hard it can be to let some things go. <em><strong>Phoebe</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>As a people pleaser, I really enjoyed reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/27/moment-that-changed-me-adele-parks-gave-up-meat-learned-how-to-say-no\">this account</a> by Adele Parks on how the strong reactions to her decision to become a <strong>vegetarian</strong> taught her how to establish boundaries. <em><strong>Aamna</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>I love seeing <strong>old petrol stations</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/27/uk-garages-philip-butler-in-pictures\">this picture essay</a> celebrates the best and most characterful of UK garages, including one mock-Tudor one from the 1920s and one in Devon that is now a tearoom. <em><strong>Phoebe</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>There’s been lots of think pieces on the dangers of <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, but Imogen West-Knights says it best when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/27/chatgpt-ai-planet-jobs-hate\">writes</a> of her fear that the upcoming AI revolution will stop our ability to use our brains and, well, think. <em><strong>Aamna</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/26/robert-jenrick-patriot-tory-leadership\">Marina Hyde</a> was funny on a day in the life of <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, which involves driving around in a Range Rover while mulling over flag photo opportunities and what gags he could text to JD Vance. <em><strong>Phoebe</strong></em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Sport</h2>    <p><em><strong>Football </strong></em>| League Two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/grimsby-manchester-united-carabao-cup-second-round-match-report\">Grimsby stunned Manchester United</a> with a 12-11 penalty shootout win after a 2-2 draw in the second round of the Carabao Cup.</p> <p><em><strong>US Open </strong></em>| Emma Raducanu <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/emma-raducanu-janice-tjen-show-of-us-open-force\">rapidly dispatched Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1</a> while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/tennis-jack-draper-pulls-out-of-us-open\">Jack Draper has pulled out</a> before the second round with arm injury. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/cameron-norrie-battles-past-comesana-at-us-open-to-set-up-djokovic-clash\">Cameron Norrie won a bruising battle with Francisco Comesaña</a> 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (0) 7-6 (4) and set up a third‑round match with Novak Djokovic.</p> <p><em><strong>Cricket </strong></em>| The Hundred <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/27/hundred-to-drop-draft-in-favour-of-open-auction-as-new-owners-influence-grows\">will adopt a new system</a> of player recruitment next season, with the draft to be dropped in favour of an open auction that gives franchises the chance to make direct signings on multi-year deals.</p> <h2>The front pages</h2>    <p>“One-third of wounded in Gaza are children” reports the <strong>Guardian. </strong>The <strong>i paper</strong> runs with “New Brexit energy tax set to hit UK on 1 January in blow to Reeves trade hopes” while the <strong>Times</strong> has “Reeves eyes tax raid on landlords to raise £2bn”. “Wind farms hike your energy bill” – that’s the <strong>Mail</strong> and “OAPs pay price for to wind farms” complains the <strong>Express</strong>.

                  "1961",
                  "Good morning. Readers, I have a confession: like millions of romantics across the world, I am a Swiftie.\nThe multiplatinum pop singer-songwriter speaks to me. It started when I was 16. Taylor Swift’s second studio album, Fearless, dropped in the UK in March 2009. That summer, much to my younger brother’s despair, I blasted Fifteen, Love Story, You Belong With Me and The Way I Loved You (the best song on the album – argue with the wall!) on repeat.\nI entered my 20s singing, badly, to 22 (and promptly stopped when a neighbour rightfully told me to shut up at 2am). I followed the ups and downs of her romantic entanglements, her REALLY cringey girl-gang era, watched in horror as she became a punchline and the target of mass contempt, and then smiled at her triumphant return during the pandemic with Folklore and Evermore. While I haven’t loved every album, and she’s been so prolific some have passed me by, I love that her music can transport me instantly back to being 15, 22, and now, gasp, 33.\nSo yes, I was pleased to learn that American football superstar Travis Kelce and Swift, self-styled “your English teacher and your gym teacher”, announced their engagement this week. The news broke the internet, prompting push notifications from major news organisations (including the Guardian), sparking the BBC to even launch a specific liveblog, and lit up group chats, including mine.\nIs that embarrassing and corny? Probably. But I like that despite her very public breakups, she kept singing about love, and kept believing in it (alright, I’ll stop now).\nHow has she managed to remain this successful, this adored, for nearly two decades? Why does Swift have such a hold on several different generations? To dig into this very important question, I spoke to Dr Lucy Bennett, an academic at Cardiff University’s school of journalism, media and culture. That’s after the headlines.\nUK news | The fertility rate for England and Wales has fallen for the third year in a row to reach a record low, figures show. Last year’s total fertility rate of 1.41 was the lowest since comparable data was first collected in 1938.\nGaza | Children under 15 years old made up almost a third of outpatients treated for wounds in field hospitals run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Gaza last year, statistics published in the Lancet reveal.\nUS news | Two children were killed and 17 injured in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\nChatGPT | Open AI is changing the way it responds to users who show emotional distress after legal action from the family of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who killed himself after months of conversations with the chatbot.\nUkraine| Russian strikes killed at least four people in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and wounded at least 24 others, city officials said on Thursday morning. Casualty numbers were expected to rise.\nTaylor Swift is quite possibly the most successful pop artist of her generation. She has reached this position, and a net worth of $1.6bn, thanks in large part to her devoted fans, who range from “oldies” like me to Gen Alpha tweens.\nBut how has she been able to connect to girls and women of all ages? Dr Lucy Bennett told me it’s down to her impressive lyricism. “I think that Swift resonates so strongly with women across generations because her songwriting often captures universal experiences, such as love, heartbreak, friendship, and self discovery, in a way that feels both deeply personal and widely relatable.”\nBennett added that many women, like myself, feel as though we have grown up alongside her. Our own personal milestones – first love, first heartbreak, moving out, being thrust from our childhood bedrooms into the adult world and the identity crisis we all seem to go through before turning 30 – seem to echo through her songs.\n“At the same time, her openness about vulnerability and resilience, and her willingness to challenge cultural double standards against women, makes her a powerful figure of identification not just for younger fans but also for older generations who recognise their own stories in her work,” Bennett said.\n***\nSwift and her fans\nSwift’s relationship with her fans can be intense, with some corners of the so-called “Swiftie fandom” veering into toxicity.\nBennett described it as one of deep connection, pointing to Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour, which “worked so well to enhance these connections, being particularly meaningful in the way it shifts through time, through Swift’s different personal situations, also allowing fans then to reflect on their own stories and experiences.”\nThe announcement of her engagement sparked a flood of videos of fans weeping on camera.

Many have grown up with her, linking the music to their specific memories and different things they have gone through in life, and so feel an emotional bond with her,” Bennett said.\nFor many fans, this is a parasocial relationship – where one person feels a sense of intimacy with someone they’ve never actually met. Which is, advantageously, a good way to build an empire.\n***\nA savvy businesswoman\nSwift is a savvy businesswoman who has been successful largely in her ability to leverage personal life stories into these juggernauts of financially lucrative events.\n“The engagement has been announced in the lead up to the new album, so the focus and media frenzy around this may work to promote the album even further... In this way, her private life becomes not only a source of artistic inspiration but also a powerful driver of wider cultural conversation and commercial success,” Bennett said.\nThis is perhaps what makes Swift stand out from her contemporaries.

Phoebe\nAs a people pleaser, I really enjoyed reading this account by Adele Parks on how the strong reactions to her decision to become a vegetarian taught her how to establish boundaries. Aamna\nI love seeing old petrol stations and this picture essay celebrates the best and most characterful of UK garages, including one mock-Tudor one from the 1920s and one in Devon that is now a tearoom. Phoebe\nThere’s been lots of think pieces on the dangers of ChatGPT, but Imogen West-Knights says it best when she writes of her fear that the upcoming AI revolution will stop our ability to use our brains and, well, think. Aamna\nMarina Hyde was funny on a day in the life of Robert Jenrick, which involves driving around in a Range Rover while mulling over flag photo opportunities and what gags he could text to JD Vance. Phoebe\nFootball | League Two Grimsby stunned Manchester United with a 12-11 penalty shootout win after a 2-2 draw in the second round of the Carabao Cup.\nUS Open | Emma Raducanu rapidly dispatched Janice Tjen 6-2, 6-1 while Jack Draper has pulled out before the second round with arm injury. Cameron Norrie won a bruising battle with Francisco Comesaña 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-7 (0) 7-6 (4) and set up a third‑round match with Novak Djokovic.\nCricket | The Hundred will adopt a new system of player recruitment next season, with the draft to be dropped in favour of an open auction that gives franchises the chance to make direct signings on multi-year deals.\n“One-third of wounded in Gaza are children” reports the Guardian.

We’re just trying to find out what’s going on.”</p> \n<p>The move has already caused concern among other parties. The Lib Dems have written to Farage to demand that he step in to reverse the “dangerous and chilling” decision. They also suggested that the move may have breached <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/councillor-and-officer-development/councillor-hub/role-councillor/code-conduct-and\">local government’s code of conduct</a>, which calls on elected officials to “submit themselves to the scrutiny”.</p> \n<p>The row in Nottinghamshire has been rumbling since a clip of an interview in June with a local councillor, in which they appeared to have only <a href=\"https://x.com/AToppingJourno/status/1937134139473277269\">a loose grasp of their brief</a>, went viral online.</p> \n<p>Relations appeared to improve and Reform figures were engaging with the local reporters.

                  "<p>Good morning. The late Ambalavaner Sivanandan, a leading voice in Britain’s anti-racist struggle, <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2021/03/the-demise-of-political-blackness/\">remarked</a>: “What Enoch Powell says today, the Conservative party says tomorrow, and the Labour party legislates on the day after.”</p> <p>It has been 50 years since Sivanandan made that observation, yet his point – that far-right rhetoric can creep into the mainstream and harden into government policy – feels as relevant now as ever before.</p> <p>All eyes were on Nigel Farage, leader of Reform, at a press conference yesterday morning as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-mass-deportations-reform-migration-small-boats-uk-politics-live\">launched</a> “Operation Restoring Justice”: a five-year plan to detain and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants.</p> <p>This radical proposal, which would shred the postwar consensus on universal human rights, is pitched as a deterrent to people seeking asylum in the UK. Farage stood alongside former party chair Zia Yusuf as they pledged to deport up to 600,000 people during the lifetime of a first Reform parliament.</p> <p>My first instinct as a journalist was to ask whether such a plan would even work, but this conference represents something much bigger than that. The real question is how much this rhetoric shifts the Overton window on the right to seek asylum in the UK, and whether we are heading towards a two-tier system of human rights. One for us, and another for those we choose to call outsiders.</p> <p>To better understand this extraordinary moment in British politics, I spoke to the Guardian political correspondent <em><strong>Aletha Adu</strong></em>, who attended the Reform conference. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Gaza </strong></em>| The UN has demanded that Israel’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/un-demands-investigations-into-gaza-hospital-killings\">investigations into unlawful killings</a> in Gaza yield results and ensure accountability.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US news </strong></em>| Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/trump-tariff-india-russian-oil-purchase\">imposed 50% tariffs</a> on most US imports from India, making good on a threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news </strong></em>| This summer is set to be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/26/summer-2025-almost-certainly-uk-warmest-record-met-office\">warmest on record</a> for the UK, the Met Office has said, after the country experienced four heatwaves.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>France </strong></em>| One of France’s most popular actors, Dany Boon, will have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/dany-boon-french-film-star-the-fake-irish-aristocrat-thierry-fialek-birles-and-the-missing-euros\">starring role in court </a>when a fake Irish aristocrat goes on trial accused of cheating him out of millions of euros. </p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Art </strong></em>| More than 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/old-master-painting-giuseppe-ghislandi-looted-by-nazis-argentina-property-listing\">has been spotted</a> on the website of an estate agent advertising a house for sale in Argentina.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: Us v Them</h2>    <p>Nigel Farage did not hold back, setting out a maximalist and radical vision at yesterday’s event at London Oxford airport. Warning of a “genuine threat to public order” without action on illegal migration, he vowed to:</p> <p>• Take Britain out of the European convention on human rights, the 1951 refugee convention, the UN convention against torture, and the Council of Europe anti-trafficking convention.</p> <p>• Detain undocumented migrants indefinitely in camps, with new accommodation for 24,000 people built on “surplus” military bases.</p> <p>• Deport people to countries including Afghanistan and Eritrea, even where they risk torture or death – with the party pledging to pay regimes, including the Taliban in Afghanistan, to take them back.</p> <p>• Detain and deport women and children alongside men.</p> <p>• Impose a lifetime ban on re-entry for anyone deported, and criminalise re-entry after deportation or the deliberate destruction of identity documents, carrying a sentence of up to five years in prison.</p> <p>“I haven’t seen anything like this,” Aletha Adu tells me straight off the back of attending the press conference. Despite the wide-ranging plan, with huge national and international implications, journalists like Aletha were only given a four-page document. “There’s little to no detail at all. It was chaos. There were lots of cheers to him for deflecting questions around whether he would sleep at night after sending people back to countries where they could be tortured or persecuted.”</p> <p>Supporters remained silent when Farage was not able to answer the simplest of questions, such as what military bases he would use, she adds. But coming up short on the detail has never been an obstacle for Farage.</p> <p>“He is able to force the biggest party to react to his framing. And that is forcing a lot of the public to also have a bigger rethink on their views on British politics,” Aletha said.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Dominating the agenda</strong></p> <p>Summer recess is normally a time for MPs of all parties to rest and recharge, before returning to the brutal business of politics in the autumn. But Farage has taken a notably different approach.</p> <p>He kicked off the summer going on tour decrying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/29/the-guardian-view-on-nigel-farage-and-lawless-britain-dangerous-hyperbole-has-real-life-consequences\">“lawless”</a> Britain and launching his campaign to get a grip on crime; by promising to spend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/21/nigel-farage-reform-spend-over-17bn-to-halve-uk-crime\">£17bn on new prisons</a> built on military bases, 30,000 more police officers a year, and to rent cells for notorious murderers and others in El Salvador.</p> <p>He bridged crime and migration by insisting the two are intrinsically linked. Flanked by Reform’s senior female figures, Sarah Pochin, the MP for Runcorn, and Andrea Jenkyns, the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, he argued that migrants from countries with “medieval” views on women pose a danger to women and girls in Britain.</p> <p>The debate was further inflamed by reports that an asylum seeker allegedly assaulted a teenage girl in Essex, sparking protests outside the hotel where he was housed and at sites elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>At every point this summer, Farage and Reform were on the front foot, while the government was left defending the policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/thursday-briefing-where-will-labour-house-asylum-seekers-now-councils-can-use-planning-law-to-close-hotels\">housing asylum seekers in hotels</a>, a system largely inherited from the Conservatives.</p> <p>“Reform have been using a lot of rallies and media appearances to frame Keir Starmer’s government as mishandling the ‘small boats crisis’. They have been saying Labour have lost control of the borders. They have been using this time during recess to position themselves as the hard line alternative to both the Tories and Labour,” Aletha said.</p> <p>“It’s definitely piled the pressure on the Labour government to sharpen their own messaging and we saw that on Tuesday’s front pages,” which splashed the announcement that the UK government was preparing to send 100 small boat migrants back to France.</p> <p>If you look back at Britain’s chequered history with asylum seekers, sitting governments have often reacted to the threat of the populist right. In the early 2000s, Tony Blair’s government introduced a crackdown that hoped to challenge rising support for far-right parties across Europe.</p> <p>In 2002, his government removed asylum seekers’ right to work and pledged to halve the number of claims. When those policies left people destitute, a then up-and-coming human rights barrister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/11/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices\">challenged the new rules</a> in court in 2003, describing them as “inhumane”. His name? Keir Starmer.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>A challenge to </strong><strong>human rights </strong></p> <p>Many of our most fundamental human rights, among them the right to be recognised as a person before the law, freedom from torture, and protection against arbitrary arrest, detention or exile, were established in the aftermath of the second world war. Their universality was historic: they applied to everyone, regardless of background. Reform now vows to take a sledgehammer to those laws and conventions.</p> <p>Farage’s plan to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, including women and children, and to withdraw the UK from human rights frameworks has, unsurprisingly, provoked a torrent of condemnation.</p> <p>Kolbassia Haoussou, director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts\">described</a> the plan as “a gift to repressive regimes” and warned Britain would be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. “This is not who we are as a country,” he said.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats and the Greens have also criticised the plan on ethical grounds. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader Daisy Cooper condemned Reform’s mass deportation plan for “ripping up” human rights and involving potential payments to autocratic regimes. The Green party MP Ellie Chowns denounced Farage’s “inflammatory” rhetoric as designed to whip up public anger and said the proposals were “unworkable”.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Ball is in Labour’s court</strong></p> <p>Parliament is set to return within the next few weeks and Labour will do so in an uncomfortable position.

This scary rhetoric shows this is a government under pressure to prove to [certain] voters… that they can also be tough when it comes to dealing with asylum seekers and dealing with this ‘small boat crisis’,” Aletha said.</p> <p>She adds that Reform’s aim is for Keir Starmer to return after summer recess feeling as though he has lost the country, despite only being one year in power. “Labour are not setting the tone at the moment, they are being pushed and pulled in all sorts of directions and it’s not really feasible when you are actually in charge. You’re supposed to be leading the agenda, not necessarily reacting to it.”</p> <p>Is there any chance that Labour will return this autumn making the case for immigration? Aletha suggests that is extremely unlikely. “I have asked them previously about opening more safe routes to make sure people don’t need to make this horrible crossing to get to this country and it’s completely off the table. They said, ‘we have enough safe routes’.” She adds it also does not seem possible “given the level of anger coming from people politically aligned on the hard right”.</p> <p>It is particularly striking that for some voters, even the extreme policy that Reform is advocating may not be enough. “I spoke to a Reform insider at the press conference who told me, ‘Even I’m scared about interacting with some of our supporters. They’re always angry. Nothing we say is good enough.’”</p> <p>I suspect No 10 will be watching closely to see how Farage’s plan lands with the public. It comes on the heels of a striking poll showing that <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52704-is-there-public-support-for-large-scale-removals-of-migrants\">45% of respondents</a> support halting all immigration and deporting those who have arrived in recent years. The danger for Labour is clear: Farage might shift the country even further to the right.</p> <p>The danger for the rest of us is that even Reform may not be able to handle the demands and response their rhetoric goes on to spark.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Notting Hill carnival</strong> is celebrated for its big sound systems and colourful parades.

                  "Good morning. The late Ambalavaner Sivanandan, a leading voice in Britain’s anti-racist struggle, remarked: “What Enoch Powell says today, the Conservative party says tomorrow, and the Labour party legislates on the day after.”\nIt has been 50 years since Sivanandan made that observation, yet his point – that far-right rhetoric can creep into the mainstream and harden into government policy – feels as relevant now as ever before.\nAll eyes were on Nigel Farage, leader of Reform, at a press conference yesterday morning as he launched “Operation Restoring Justice”: a five-year plan to detain and deport hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants.\nThis radical proposal, which would shred the postwar consensus on universal human rights, is pitched as a deterrent to people seeking asylum in the UK. Farage stood alongside former party chair Zia Yusuf as they pledged to deport up to 600,000 people during the lifetime of a first Reform parliament.\nMy first instinct as a journalist was to ask whether such a plan would even work, but this conference represents something much bigger than that. The real question is how much this rhetoric shifts the Overton window on the right to seek asylum in the UK, and whether we are heading towards a two-tier system of human rights. One for us, and another for those we choose to call outsiders.\nTo better understand this extraordinary moment in British politics, I spoke to the Guardian political correspondent Aletha Adu, who attended the Reform conference. That’s after the headlines.\nGaza | The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza yield results and ensure accountability.\nUS news | Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on most US imports from India, making good on a threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil\nUK news | This summer is set to be the warmest on record for the UK, the Met Office has said, after the country experienced four heatwaves.\nFrance | One of France’s most popular actors, Dany Boon, will have a starring role in court when a fake Irish aristocrat goes on trial accused of cheating him out of millions of euros. \nArt | More than 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master has been spotted on the website of an estate agent advertising a house for sale in Argentina.\nNigel Farage did not hold back, setting out a maximalist and radical vision at yesterday’s event at London Oxford airport.

But Farage has taken a notably different approach.\nHe kicked off the summer going on tour decrying “lawless” Britain and launching his campaign to get a grip on crime; by promising to spend £17bn on new prisons built on military bases, 30,000 more police officers a year, and to rent cells for notorious murderers and others in El Salvador.\nHe bridged crime and migration by insisting the two are intrinsically linked. Flanked by Reform’s senior female figures, Sarah Pochin, the MP for Runcorn, and Andrea Jenkyns, the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, he argued that migrants from countries with “medieval” views on women pose a danger to women and girls in Britain.\nThe debate was further inflamed by reports that an asylum seeker allegedly assaulted a teenage girl in Essex, sparking protests outside the hotel where he was housed and at sites elsewhere in the country.\nAt every point this summer, Farage and Reform were on the front foot, while the government was left defending the policy of housing asylum seekers in hotels, a system largely inherited from the Conservatives.\n“Reform have been using a lot of rallies and media appearances to frame Keir Starmer’s government as mishandling the ‘small boats crisis’.

Phoebe\nCycling | Britain’s Ben Turner outfoxed Belgian Jasper Philipsen in a sprint finish to win stage four of the Vuelta a España, with Frenchman David Gaudu taking the leader’s red jersey from Jonas Vingegaard.\nFootball | Kobbie Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after being squeezed to the margins by Ruben Amorim. The midfielder has not played a minute of the team’s two games this season.\nFormula One | Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas will be back on the Formula One starting grid next season after Cadillac announced the signing of the veteran drivers as the team’s debut pairing.\nLead story in the Guardian is “Farage accused of ‘ugly’ populism over plans for mass deportations”. The Express has “Farage: ‘I will deport 600,000 illegal migrants’”. “Finally, a politician who gets it” – that’s the Mail while the Telegraph’s headline should be allowed to sink in: “Taliban to give Farage deal on migrants”. More on that in the i paper: “Farage’s promise to ‘deport ‘600,000’ migrants involves deals with Taliban and Iran’s Ayatollah”. “Farage: end the scourge” is the Metro’s version. The Mirror pushes back with “Britain is better than this”. The Times throwing it back on the government makes for a strangely understated headline: “Labour bid to head off small boats hits trouble”. Splash in the Financial Times is “US offers air and command back-up for Ukraine force”.\nMissing in the Amazon: the protector and the poacher – episode three\nRevisited: Bruno Pereira was considered one of the great Indigenous protectors of his generation.

It was the biggest ecological disaster to hit the island, ruining the local fishing industry that people had depended on for generations.\nRealising the extent of the damage, a group of women decided they would have to learn to farm the land in order to feed their families. They were soon training in agro-ecology, permaculture and beekeeping.\nThis year they have grown a tonne of organic fruit and vegetables. Not only are they able to feed their loved ones but they are selling the surplus to support their families, many of whom are still struggling financially. “I’ve found something that keeps me going, and every day we’re getting food to take home,” says Marie Claire Robinson.\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\nAnd finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

In the past, Farage has been sparing in his use of hardline rhetoric around migration, cautious not to get too close to the arguments of the far right.</p> <p>On Tuesday, however, he cut loose, describing irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”, referring to men who cross the Channel repeatedly as being of “fighting age”, and saying: “We are not far away from major civil disorder.”</p> <p>With his party 10 points ahead in the polls, Farage has been facing a dilemma over whether to lean into his image as a firebrand rightwing populist or to try to appear more statesmanlike in an attempt to position himself for Downing Street.</p> <p>Gawain Towler, his former head of communications, said: “Farage should not be seen as a street-fighting man. He plans to govern for the whole country and needs to be seen in that light.”</p> <p>Some in Reform described Tuesday’s speech in a similar light, saying it constituted the kind of thought-through policy proposal that voters would seek in a party of government.</p> <p>Others, however, argue Farage’s own answers to detailed policy questions showed he was more interested in the politics of the plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts\">than whether it could work</a>.</p> <p>Asked by the Guardian for example why he had costed his plan at £10bn, when the Centre for Migration Control <a href=\"https://www.rupertlowe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mass-deportations_-plan_A_Blueprint.pdf\">had estimated</a> a near-identical plan would cost £47.5bn, Farage said dismissively: “Zia [Yusuf, his Reform colleague] is really good at maths.”</p> <p>The gamble for the Reform leader, say experts, lies less in whether the public care about such policy details and more about whether they agree with Farage’s argument that the validity of a person’s asylum claim matters less than how they entered the country.</p> <p>Joe Twyman, the co-founder of the polling company Deltapoll, said: “About one in six people endorse very strong views on legal or settled migrants, and that number hasn’t really changed.</p> <p>“What Farage is doing is tapping into a longstanding but still relatively small minority.

                  "Halfway into his press conference on Tuesday – during which he announced his party would deport asylum seekers en masse if it entered government – Nigel Farage sounded a note of triumphalism.\n“One of the most interesting things about this press conference … is the questions being asked are about the practicalities of individual pieces of implementation,” he said. “What I notice is there is very little pushback from the media against the idea that we really are in very, very big trouble in this country.”\nAt the heart of the Reform leader’s speech was a political gamble. In the past, Farage has been sparing in his use of hardline rhetoric around migration, cautious not to get too close to the arguments of the far right.\nOn Tuesday, however, he cut loose, describing irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”, referring to men who cross the Channel repeatedly as being of “fighting age”, and saying: “We are not far away from major civil disorder.”\nWith his party 10 points ahead in the polls, Farage has been facing a dilemma over whether to lean into his image as a firebrand rightwing populist or to try to appear more statesmanlike in an attempt to position himself for Downing Street.\nGawain Towler, his former head of communications, said: “Farage should not be seen as a street-fighting man. He plans to govern for the whole country and needs to be seen in that light.”\nSome in Reform described Tuesday’s speech in a similar light, saying it constituted the kind of thought-through policy proposal that voters would seek in a party of government.\nOthers, however, argue Farage’s own answers to detailed policy questions showed he was more interested in the politics of the plan than whether it could work.\nAsked by the Guardian for example why he had costed his plan at £10bn, when the Centre for Migration Control had estimated a near-identical plan would cost £47.5bn, Farage said dismissively: “Zia [Yusuf, his Reform colleague] is really good at maths.”\nThe gamble for the Reform leader, say experts, lies less in whether the public care about such policy details and more about whether they agree with Farage’s argument that the validity of a person’s asylum claim matters less than how they entered the country.\nJoe Twyman, the co-founder of the polling company Deltapoll, said: “About one in six people endorse very strong views on legal or settled migrants, and that number hasn’t really changed.\n“What Farage is doing is tapping into a longstanding but still relatively small minority. The reason he’s doing this is for the vibes – he wants people to hear a hardline message on migration and thinks most people won’t care about the detail.”\nSunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, said: “Between a fifth and a quarter have no sympathy for people crossing the Channel – thats Farage’s core vote.\n“Another fifth are ‘team compassion’, but most are in between: they want control but also care whether an asylum seeker’s claim is justified.”\nFarage was quickly proved correct, however, in one respect. While journalists were willing to ask tough questions about the fundamental tenets of Reform’s plan, Downing Street seemed less willing to.\nAsked by reporters whether Keir Starmer had moral misgivings about Farage’s speech or the language he used, a spokesperson replied: “We totally recognise the concerns that the British people have with the surge in illegal migration … but we are focused on taking forward the practical actions and solutions that will deal with it.”\nThe Conservatives were even more reluctant to criticise the Reform leader. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, accused Farage of “reheating and recycling plans that the Conservatives have already announced”.\nLabour and the Tories have found it difficult to respond to public concern about the levels of legal and illegal migration.\nBut some say the tendency of the government in particular to accept the premise of Reform’s arguments and argue about implementation carries its own risks.\n“Farage is OK – in a three-way split he might be able to get a minority government on 26%-27%,” said Katwala. “Starmer, however, can only hold his coalition of voters together if he talks about control and compassion.\n“If Labour is completely on the fence, it risks not keeping either side happy.”",

                  "<p>Good morning. My mum is a livestock farmer in Kent. This year her hay crop was down by 50% because the spring rains never came. She’s not alone – up and down the UK, farmers have watched their fields turn brown and their hay crops collapse.</p> <p>Hay keeps animals alive over winter (when there is no fresh grass outside) and some farmers are already selling off cows because they can’t guarantee they will be able to feed them. From extreme drought to biblical floods, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/02/farmers-climate-crisis-livelihood-extreme-weather-study\">more than 80%</a> of UK farmers are worried wild swings in weather are affecting their ability to earn a living.</p> <p>Globally, farmers are on the frontline of climate change and livelihoods are on the line. Last year, heatwaves wiped out onions in India and cocoa in Ivory Coast. Most recently wildfires and heatwaves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/25/we-cannot-do-it-the-way-our-fathers-did-farmers-across-europe-struggle-to-adapt-to-the-climate-crisis\">have driven losses</a> of olives, citrus fruits and vegetables across Europe.</p> <p>Not only is this bad news for farmers, but supply chains are buckling under the pressure, driving an increase in the cost of food for consumers. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to <em><strong>Dr</strong></em> <em><strong>Maximilian Kotz</strong></em>, a Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow at Barcelona Supercomputing Center, about “climateflation” and how environmental breakdown affects the cost of what we eat. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Israel-Gaza war</strong></em> | Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/journalists-among-people-killed-by-israeli-strike-on-gaza-hospital\">struck the same place again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded</a>, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Schools will need to give <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/uk-elections-electoral-commission-school-lessons-vote-16\">democracy lessons to children</a> from the age of 11 and ask teachers to leave their politics at the classroom door to help prepare for votes at 16, the head of the UK elections watchdog has said.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Health</strong></em> | People using the weight loss jab Mounjaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/25/mounjaro-users-in-uk-warned-against-bulk-buying-before-autumn-price-rise\">have been warned against</a> switching to black market sellers or bulk buying after its manufacturer announced the UK will get a significant price rise this autumn.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US news</strong></em> | Some national guard units patrolling the US capital at the direction of Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/trump-washington-dc-national-guard-weapons\">have started carrying firearms</a>, an escalation of the president’s military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by his defence department.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Ministers are introducing a clearer legal definition of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/26/uk-to-clarify-definition-of-honour-based-abuse-in-drive-to-cut-violence-against-women-and-girls\">“honour-based” abuse</a> in an attempt to catch more perpetrators and protect women and girls from violence and coercion.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘Consumers are starting to see these things directly for themselves’</h2>    <p>It has been known for a long time that the amount of food a farmer produces is linked to climate conditions (hence why farmers are usually clued up to the forecast). This is of course natural – weather fluctuates. However, in recent years temperature extremes have become stronger, and records are being broken across the globe. As a result, a new area of research has started to evolve over the past five-ish years: how the climate crisis is affecting the price of food.</p> <p>“In the last year or two there have been many widespread examples of this phenomenon playing out,” said Maximilian Kotz. “It’s something that people are really noticing – not just researchers who look at the data in detail, but people in the industry, and even consumers, are starting to see these things directly for themselves.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What are the effects of wildfires and heatwaves across Europe?</strong></p> <p>We’ve all read about wildfires and heatwaves ravaging southern Europe. Not only has this had a devastating impact on people’s lives but it has also having an concerning impact on food, with farmers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/25/we-cannot-do-it-the-way-our-fathers-did-farmers-across-europe-struggle-to-adapt-to-the-climate-crisis\">struggling to grow crops</a> that their forebears did for hundreds of years.</p> <p>This means the price of traditional Mediterranean produce such as olives, citrus fruits, vegetables and wine are likely to rise. In the UK, long dry spells have also affected the production of cereals, potatoes, carrots and broccoli. Britain’s largest retailers are warning food prices are already being driven up by hot weather.</p> <p>This is not an isolated year, and crop losses are only set to increase in the coming years as the climate crisis gets worse. In the EU, the average annual loss is expected to increase by up to two-thirds by 2050, according to analysis by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.</p> <p>And it’s not just in Europe where agriculture is being hit. Shrivelled cacao pods and failed harvests caused by extreme temperatures in west Africa have caused an increase in the price of chocolate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/12/climate-crisis-threatens-the-banana-the-worlds-most-popular-fruit-research-shows\">Even bananas are not safe</a> – rising temperatures, extreme weather and climate-related pests are pummelling Guatemala, Costa Rica and Colombia, where the world’s most popular fruit is grown.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What are some examples of price spikes in recent years?</strong></p> <p>Kotz and his team <a href=\"https://www.bsc.es/news/bsc-news/countries-across-the-world-see-food-price-shocks-climate-extremes-research-involving-bsc-shows\">looked at data from 18 countries</a> to find examples of price spikes associated with extreme weather events.</p> <p>They found that in 2022, vegetable prices spiked by 80% in Arizona and California after extreme summer drought. In the same year, a drought in the Horn of Africa – the worst there in 40 years – resulted in food prices being 40% higher in March the following year.</p> <p>In 2024, global cocoa prices were 280% higher in April after a heatwave two months prior in Ivory Coast and Ghana (together, these two countries account for 60% of global cacao production). A heatwave in May of the same year caused a 80% increase in the price of onions and potatoes in India.</p> <p>At its most basic level, this is an issue of supply and demand: if droughts and heat stress destroy crop yields, then prices of that crop go up.</p> <p>Kotz said: “It is quite striking that very often the products that are most affected are fresh fruit and vegetable produce. There are obvious reasons why that could be the case – essentially those are products that are harder to store, and normally they have a shorter time span between production and going to the market.” The impact on the market is amplified as you can’t stockpile perishable produce, whereas grains and rice can be stored to buffer disruption.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How ‘climateflation’ will change the way we eat</strong></p> <p>The term ‘climateflation’ refers to the rising cost of living caused by the climate crisis. Fundamentally, disruptions to agriculture have an impact on how much people have to fork out for food. Extreme weather causes short-term price shocks, but hotter average temperatures cause food inflation spikes that can last up to 12 months, according to Kotz’s <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01173-x\">research from last year</a>. “We were able to see that we really are going to be expecting persistently higher food prices under future temperature increases,” he said.</p> <p>A report from the Autonomy Institute thinktank found that increasingly extreme weather could drive up food prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/28/climateflation-could-push-up-uk-food-prices-by-more-than-a-third-by-2050-report-says\">by more than a third</a> by 2050 for British consumers.</p> <p>The cost of living crisis is already squeezing UK household budgets with high food, energy and housing costs, while wages remain stagnant. Food makes up a large share of household spending – especially in emerging economies. Typically, healthy food (such as fresh fruit and vegetables) is twice as expensive per calorie as less healthy food. Research from <a href=\"https://foodfoundation.org.uk/publication/broken-plate-2025\">the Food Foundation</a> has shown that spending on healthy products is usually where people cut back in times of food price increases, particularly in low-income households.</p> <p>This could exacerbate a range of health issues, from malnutrition to chronic diet-related conditions including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers. Poor diets have also been linked to poor mental health, according to the Food Foundation. “We expect this kind of food price inflation induced by climate change would most of all affect the poorest households,” said Kotz. “That then has many implications long-term for wider societal health.”</p> <p>The trend with rising food prices is structural, so it will keep building as long as temperatures increase. “It’s clear that the main thing that we can do to reduce these impacts is just to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” said Kotz. “Even though it’s very obvious, I think it’s always important to bring people’s awareness back to the underlying driver.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Knesset member Ofer Cassif <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/25/israel-protest-tel-aviv-army-war-gaza\">writes in the Guardian</a> on army reservists refusing to take up arms as <strong>Israel’s anti-war movement</strong> grows bolder. “In private talks between family members or in public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are realising that participating in military service is to be complicit,” he says. <em><strong>Charlie Lindlar, newsletters team</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>An interesting and potentially dangerous case of humans treating <strong>wild animals</strong> like pets is unfolding in Lyme Bay where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/25/the-perilous-charm-of-reggie-the-friendly-dolphin\">Reggie the ‘friendly’ dolphin</a> is apparently asking people for belly rubs, but also “trying to drown” female swimmers.

Last year, heatwaves wiped out onions in India and cocoa in Ivory Coast. Most recently wildfires and heatwaves have driven losses of olives, citrus fruits and vegetables across Europe.\nNot only is this bad news for farmers, but supply chains are buckling under the pressure, driving an increase in the cost of food for consumers. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Dr Maximilian Kotz, a Marie Curie postdoctoral research fellow at Barcelona Supercomputing Center, about “climateflation” and how environmental breakdown affects the cost of what we eat. That’s after the headlines.\nIsrael-Gaza war | Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then struck the same place again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.\nUK news | Schools will need to give democracy lessons to children from the age of 11 and ask teachers to leave their politics at the classroom door to help prepare for votes at 16, the head of the UK elections watchdog has said.\nHealth | People using the weight loss jab Mounjaro have been warned against switching to black market sellers or bulk buying after its manufacturer announced the UK will get a significant price rise this autumn.\nUS news | Some national guard units patrolling the US capital at the direction of Donald Trump have started carrying firearms, an escalation of the president’s military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by his defence department.\nUK news | Ministers are introducing a clearer legal definition of “honour-based” abuse in an attempt to catch more perpetrators and protect women and girls from violence and coercion.\nIt has been known for a long time that the amount of food a farmer produces is linked to climate conditions (hence why farmers are usually clued up to the forecast). This is of course natural – weather fluctuates. However, in recent years temperature extremes have become stronger, and records are being broken across the globe. As a result, a new area of research has started to evolve over the past five-ish years: how the climate crisis is affecting the price of food.\n“In the last year or two there have been many widespread examples of this phenomenon playing out,” said Maximilian Kotz. “It’s something that people are really noticing – not just researchers who look at the data in detail, but people in the industry, and even consumers, are starting to see these things directly for themselves.”\n***\nWhat are the effects of wildfires and heatwaves across Europe?\nWe’ve all read about wildfires and heatwaves ravaging southern Europe. Not only has this had a devastating impact on people’s lives but it has also having an concerning impact on food, with farmers struggling to grow crops that their forebears did for hundreds of years.\nThis means the price of traditional Mediterranean produce such as olives, citrus fruits, vegetables and wine are likely to rise. In the UK, long dry spells have also affected the production of cereals, potatoes, carrots and broccoli. Britain’s largest retailers are warning food prices are already being driven up by hot weather.\nThis is not an isolated year, and crop losses are only set to increase in the coming years as the climate crisis gets worse. In the EU, the average annual loss is expected to increase by up to two-thirds by 2050, according to analysis by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission.\nAnd it’s not just in Europe where agriculture is being hit. Shrivelled cacao pods and failed harvests caused by extreme temperatures in west Africa have caused an increase in the price of chocolate. Even bananas are not safe – rising temperatures, extreme weather and climate-related pests are pummelling Guatemala, Costa Rica and Colombia, where the world’s most popular fruit is grown.\n***\nWhat are some examples of price spikes in recent years?\nKotz and his team looked at data from 18 countries to find examples of price spikes associated with extreme weather events.\nThey found that in 2022, vegetable prices spiked by 80% in Arizona and California after extreme summer drought. In the same year, a drought in the Horn of Africa – the worst there in 40 years – resulted in food prices being 40% higher in March the following year.\nIn 2024, global cocoa prices were 280% higher in April after a heatwave two months prior in Ivory Coast and Ghana (together, these two countries account for 60% of global cacao production). A heatwave in May of the same year caused a 80% increase in the price of onions and potatoes in India.\nAt its most basic level, this is an issue of supply and demand: if droughts and heat stress destroy crop yields, then prices of that crop go up.\nKotz said: “It is quite striking that very often the products that are most affected are fresh fruit and vegetable produce. There are obvious reasons why that could be the case – essentially those are products that are harder to store, and normally they have a shorter time span between production and going to the market.” The impact on the market is amplified as you can’t stockpile perishable produce, whereas grains and rice can be stored to buffer disruption.\n***\nHow ‘climateflation’ will change the way we eat\nThe term ‘climateflation’ refers to the rising cost of living caused by the climate crisis. Fundamentally, disruptions to agriculture have an impact on how much people have to fork out for food. Extreme weather causes short-term price shocks, but hotter average temperatures cause food inflation spikes that can last up to 12 months, according to Kotz’s research from last year. “We were able to see that we really are going to be expecting persistently higher food prices under future temperature increases,” he said.\nA report from the Autonomy Institute thinktank found that increasingly extreme weather could drive up food prices by more than a third by 2050 for British consumers.\nThe cost of living crisis is already squeezing UK household budgets with high food, energy and housing costs, while wages remain stagnant. Food makes up a large share of household spending – especially in emerging economies. Typically, healthy food (such as fresh fruit and vegetables) is twice as expensive per calorie as less healthy food. Research from the Food Foundation has shown that spending on healthy products is usually where people cut back in times of food price increases, particularly in low-income households.\nThis could exacerbate a range of health issues, from malnutrition to chronic diet-related conditions including coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers. Poor diets have also been linked to poor mental health, according to the Food Foundation. “We expect this kind of food price inflation induced by climate change would most of all affect the poorest households,” said Kotz. “That then has many implications long-term for wider societal health.”\nThe trend with rising food prices is structural, so it will keep building as long as temperatures increase. “It’s clear that the main thing that we can do to reduce these impacts is just to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions,” said Kotz. “Even though it’s very obvious, I think it’s always important to bring people’s awareness back to the underlying driver.”\nKnesset member Ofer Cassif writes in the Guardian on army reservists refusing to take up arms as Israel’s anti-war movement grows bolder. “In private talks between family members or in public declarations of objection, more and more Israelis are realising that participating in military service is to be complicit,” he says.

                  "<p>The Home Office has promised a “big surge” in asylum hotel closures in the new year, with five more to shut in the coming months, as ministers face mounting pressure over the government’s record on immigration.</p> \n<p>Speaking after a weekend of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”.</p> \n<p>Nigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/24/asylum-appeals-process-overhaul-home-office\">Home Office to overhaul asylum appeals system as it tries to clear claims backlog</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.</p> \n<p>Writing for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.</p> \n<p>“The time has come to put this country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”</p> \n<p>Farage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.</p> \n<p>Eagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system.</p> \n<p>“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.</p> \n<p>“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.</p> \n<p>“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”</p> \n<p>A government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.</p> \n<p>The number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f5a0dc41-3a25-405d-b901-5be9175e1b57\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WX0JMRCtBvc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Home Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.</p> \n<p>Rising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.</p> \n<p>Findlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”</p> \n<p>The fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/19/high-court-asylum-hotels-ruling-leaves-cooper-scrambling-for-alternatives\">removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex</a> after local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/20/more-england-councils-plan-challenge-essex-epping-asylum-bell-hotel\">emboldened other councils to consider similar action</a>.</p> \n<p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/23/members-of-far-right-party-organising-asylum-hotel-protests-across-uk-facebook-posts-show\">Members of far-right party organising asylum hotel protests across UK, Facebook posts show</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.</p> \n<p>A two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.</p> \n<p>Despite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-one-in-one-out-deal-allow-uk-return-small-boat-migrants-france\">UK-France treaty</a> signed in July has already led to detentions, insiders say, while the “deport now appeal later” scheme has expanded to 23 countries, with 66 charter flights removing hundreds, including serious offenders, in the past year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong></strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                  "The Home Office has promised a “big surge” in asylum hotel closures in the new year, with five more to shut in the coming months, as ministers face mounting pressure over the government’s record on immigration.\nSpeaking after a weekend of protests and counter-protests over the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the government had inherited a “border security system in tatters” and accused opposition parties of offering “the fag packet plans without the substance on delivery”.\nNigel Farage will on Tuesday outline proposals for a sweeping deportation programme, including the mass removal of asylum seekers arriving in small boats, the detention of new arrivals at military bases, and the rapid expansion of flights to Rwanda and other countries willing to take asylum seekers.\nThe Reform UK leader’s plans also include withdrawing from the European convention on human rights and replacing the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights prioritising citizens’ rights.\nWriting for the Telegraph, he described international treaties governing human rights law as “malign influences” that had been “allowed to frustrate deportations”.\n“The time has come to put this country first,” Farage said. “This is all a question of priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated international treaties and human rights lawyers?”\nFarage’s intervention comes after a Times poll by YouGov found that 71% of voters believe Keir Starmer is handling the asylum seeker hotel crisis poorly, including a majority of Labour supporters. The findings have intensified pressure on ministers to demonstrate visible progress before a winter in which the use of hotels remains one of the most politically fraught aspects of the small boats crisis.\nEagle, the border security and asylum minister, said Reform’s plans were unworkable and accused the Conservatives of leaving behind a broken system.\n“This government inherited chaos in the asylum system and a border security system in tatters,” she said. “Since the election we have been rebuilding the foundations of both, saving £1bn in asylum accommodation costs, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, and bringing forward new laws to make it easier to deport sex offenders, which both Reform and the Tories voted against.\n“Under the Tories we had years of fantasy solutions, which we were told would stop the boats, but which simply cost a fortune and had no impact. Reform look to be offering more of the same. These are back-of-the-fag packet plans without the substance on delivery.\n“Illegal migration is a complex, global problem requiring serious and sustainable policies, including working closely with partners overseas. Only the Labour government is offering that kind of plan.”\nA government source said “by the end of the year at least five more hotels are expected to be closed, with a big surge in closures in the new year”, describing the move as part of a wider effort to end hotel use entirely.\nThe number of hotels accommodating asylum seekers has fallen from a peak of 400 in 2023, when costs reached £9m a day, to just more than 200 now, with a reduced daily cost of £5.5m, insiders say. In the first half of this year alone, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels fell by 6,000 – a 16% reduction.\nHome Office figures show overall asylum costs have dropped by 11%, delivering £1bn in savings last year and a forecast of at least another £1bn to be saved next year. Ministers argue the closures show tangible progress, even as critics continue to highlight delays in processing claims and challenges in securing alternative housing.\nRising public anger over asylum accommodation has been fuelled by high-profile criminal cases and violent incidents. The Scottish Tory leader, Russell Findlay, defended protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers after Sadeq Nikzad, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant, was jailed for nine years in June for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in October 2023.\nFindlay said: “It’s understandable in those circumstances why communities would question the entire integrity and safety of the immigration system. As long as that’s being done lawfully and respectfully that is an entirely right way to protest.”\nThe fallout from the Epping asylum hotel ruling has also escalated tensions. The high court recently ordered the removal of asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Essex after local Conservative-led councils mounted a legal challenge. The decision has emboldened other councils to consider similar action.\nKemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservatives, is hosting a call on Tuesday with Tory councillors, planning law experts and senior party strategists to discuss how councils can coordinate further legal challenges. Attenders include Lord Charles Banner KC; the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp; James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary; Holly Whitbread, a cabinet member at Epping Forest council; and John Cope, the chair of the Conservative councillors’ association.\nThe Guardian understands the session will aim to “help and encourage Conservative councils to take the lead in fighting to close asylum hotels in their constituency” and “give genuine advice based on a serious plan of action”.\nA two-day trial begins on Tuesday at Chelmsford crown court of a man charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl outside the Bell hotel – a case that has fuelled anger locally and sparked fresh protests across Essex.\nDespite highlighting falling costs, declining hotel use and tougher enforcement, Labour remains under political pressure. The government has pointed to new deals with France, Bulgaria, Romania, India, Vietnam and Iraq aimed at disrupting trafficking and speeding removals.\nA UK-France treaty signed in July has already led to detentions, insiders say, while the “deport now appeal later” scheme has expanded to 23 countries, with 66 charter flights removing hundreds, including serious offenders, in the past year.\n\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
