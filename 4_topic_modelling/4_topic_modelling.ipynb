         "Thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets to rejoice at Jair Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup, as progressive politicians celebrated the historic move and rightwing figures linked to Donald Trump responded with anger and threats.\nChile's leftwing president, Gabriel Boric, led regional congratulations of the decision to jail Bolsonaro for 27 years for leading a criminal organisation that sought to seize power after the far-right populist lost the 2022 election.\n“My respect to Brazilian democracy which fended off a coup attempt and today judges and convicts those responsible for it. They tried to destroy [democracy] and today it emerges strengthened,” Boric tweeted, adding: “Democracy always!”\nColombia's president, Gustavo Petro, said: “All putschists must be convicted.

Wearing a trim khaki-green jacket, the European Commission president smiled, shook hands and exchanged air kisses with some of the politicians, who had front-row seats for her annual state of the union address.</p> <p>The hour-long <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/ov/SPEECH_25_2053\">speech</a> on Wednesday had a stark message: Europe must fight for its place in an “unforgiving” world, facing major powers that are either “ambivalent or openly hostile” towards it.</p> <p>Only minutes after she sat down, she was hearing equally tough responses. “We are losing Europeans; we’re not taking them with us. We’re weak when they want protection,” Valérie Hayer, leader of the centrist Renew group, told her. “The summer was very painful,” said Green leader Bas Eickhout. “Europe has entered a world of power, yet we are still playing chess in a boxing match.”</p> <p>These were more than routine rhetorical flourishes. This summer was one of harsh realities for the EU. The US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/27/eu-delegation-poised-for-trump-trade-talks-in-scotland\">trade deal </a>von der Leyen signed with Donald Trump in July was an unequal bargain, decried by right and left as a humiliation for Europe. Russia escalated its attacks on Ukraine, while EU leaders were left wincing at the spectacle of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine\">Trump’s red carpet welcome for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin</a>, in Alaska. Israel’s war on Gaza continued relentlessly, killing more than 64,000 people and bringing famine to the strip, while EU countries were unable to agree on modest sanctions against Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/eu-wildfires-worst-year-on-record-as-season-continues\">forest fires, exacerbated by the climate crisis, broke records</a> as flames consumed 1m hectares across affected countries, an area equivalent to about one-third of Belgium.</p> <p>Surveying the season’s political news, Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister who is widely revered in Brussels, said events had <a href=\"https://www.meetingrimini.org/en/turn-skepticism-into-action-mario-draghis-speech-at-the-meeting/\">“swept away any illusion</a> that economics alone could ensure geopolitical power”. Europe, he said, was “ill-equipped in a world where geo-economics, security and the stability of supply sources, rather than efficiency” shape international trade relations.

She arrived in Brussels in 2019 promising to lead a “geopolitical commission”, making the EU a foreign policy player, rather than simply a market. This week, an <a href=\"https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2025/09/09/10-points-eurobazooka/\">opinion poll </a>in the EU’s five largest member states (Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland) showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/majority-in-eu-biggest-states-believes-bloc-sold-out-in-us-tariff-deal-poll-donald-trump\">52% found her trade deal a “humiliation”</a>, while 75% thought she had defended European interests “very” or “fairly” badly.</p> <p>Anna Cavazzini, a Green MEP who chairs the European parliament’s internal market committee, has also encountered such negative verdicts. The message that a “strong EU” would defend European interests against “a bully on the other side of the Atlantic” had “really resonated with my voters, who are in eastern Germany and not the biggest fans of the EU, usually”. The outcome left them disappointed, she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Cavazzini does not fix all the blame on the commission, saying that many EU governments shunned more assertive stances to Trump’s tariff threats, while seeking to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/french-pm-says-eu-tariff-american-bourbon-probably-mistaken-2025-03-16/\">protect favoured industries</a>. Member states “were holding the commission back”, industries had their own interests in mind and Europe was not “fully united behind the idea that you have to stand up for Trump,” she said.</p> <p>Under the deal announced at the US president’s Turnberry golf course, the EU agreed to eliminate tariffs on many US goods, while accepting 15% duties on its products and 50% on steel. Von der Leyen, who has long argued for more clean homegrown energy, promised Europe would buy $750bn (€640bn) of US liquified natural gas, oil and nuclear products by 2028.</p> <p>In Strasbourg, von der Leyen came out fighting for what she called “the best possible deal out there” that provided “crucial stability in our relations with the US at a time of grave global insecurity”. European officials argue that the deal was necessary to safeguard jobs, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/what-security-guarantees-might-ukraine-get-in-return-for-a-peace-deal\">US involvement in defending Ukraine</a>. “[Is] what happened during the summer something that will make Europeans proud?” asked one senior EU official. “No. But this doesn’t mean that the reaction and the management of the situation was not intelligent.

Announcing Bolsonaro's sentence for crimes including coup d'etat and violently attempting to abolish Brazil's democracy, the supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes said: “[He tried to] annihilate the essential pillars of the democratic rule-of-law state … ​the greatest consequence ​[of which] … would have been the return of dictatorship to Brazil​.”\nAn emergency session of the UN security council will convene on Friday at Poland's request, as Warsaw seeks to rally support after an incursion into the country by Russian drones on Wednesday.\nEuropean allies promised to support Poland, including a commitment by Germany to strengthen its military presence on Nato's eastern flank. However, some disputed whether the incursion was a deliberate attack on Poland by Russia, and Trump offered little in the way of public support.\nOn Thursday, the US president told reporters the incursion could have been a “mistake”, adding: “I'm not happy about anything to do with the whole situation, but hopefully that's going to come to an end.”\nWhat did Poland say about Trump's comments? In response, Poland's foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, wrote on X: “No, that wasn't a mistake.”\nPrince Harry has made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of military personnel who have been seriously injured in the three-year war against Russia.\nNone of the 11 people killed in a US military strike on a boat in the Caribbean last week were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, the island's interior minister has said. The attack came after the vessel had turned around and was heading back to shore, according to US media reports.\nTwo Democratic senators claim they have reached the “inescapable conclusion” that Israel is acting on a systematic plan to destroy and ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza, and they say the US is complicit.\nThe US government sued Uber yesterday, accusing the ride-sharing company of violating federal law by discriminating against passengers with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration can purge more than 1,600 research grants issued by the National Science Foundation (NSF) worth more than $1bn, after a judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction in a case brought by a coalition of organizations representing thousands of scientists.\nLast week, Peter Mandelson was described as durable to an audience of foreign policy top brass, writes Patrick Wintour. The diplomat, who was sacked this week over his friendship with Jeffery Epstein, had a self-confidence and style that made him a big hitter in Washington at a time when a British Labour government could easily have found itself largely shunned or, even worse, ignored as irrelevant.\nThe Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term “ecoanxiety” to describe the chronic fear of environmental doom, as studies show that many children are fearful of the future state of the climate. However, the term does not fully encapsulate the feelings of young people who endure natural disasters on the frontlines of climate breakdown. Here, people in their 20s around world share their experiences.\nWhile some humans find they have two left feet on the dancefloor, octopuses manage to coordinate eight highly flexible limbs across a host of behaviours, from foraging to den-building, or moving around the seafloor. Now researchers say they have completed the most comprehensive study of its kind, revealing that – like primates, rodents and fish – the cephalopods prefer to use particular limbs for certain tasks.\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

         "[\"Good morning. Just how many migrants in the UK are undocumented?\\nTabloid headlines can make it seem like the number is huge, so perhaps a new YouGov poll suggesting a significant gap between public perception and reality should be no surprise. Nearly half of Britons (47%) believe there are more undocumented migrants living in the UK than those here legally. Meanwhile, 45% of respondents said they support stopping all immigration and carrying out deportations of people who have arrived in recent years.\\nTensions are playing out on the streets, with protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers attracting national attention, including in Epping, Essex, where hundreds of people gathered over several weekends after the arrest of a resident on suspicion of sexual assault. More protests are expected over the next few days. Adding to the pressure, police are also preparing for possible protests in support of Palestine Action over the weekend, despite the group's recent proscription as a terrorist organisation. Officers have warned that anyone carrying placards or banners expressing support could face arrest and incarceration in our already overcrowded prisons.\\nSo who is behind the anti-immigration protests, and what's driving them? And could this weekend become a flashpoint? To explore this further, I spoke to the Guardian's senior reporter Ben Quinn, who has spent years reporting on the far right.\\nUS immigration | A new report found hundreds of credible reported cases of human rights abuses in US immigration detention centres. The alleged abuses uncovered include physical and sexual abuse of detainees.\\nProtest | Naomi Klein and Angela Davis are among dozens of international scholars and writers who have signed a letter to the Guardian calling on the UK government to reverse the ban on Palestine Action.\\nRussia | Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff have held talks in Moscow, two days before a Friday deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the Ukraine war.\\nSpain | A local authority in south-east Spain has banned Muslims from using public facilities such as civic centres and gyms to celebrate the religious festivals Eid. The ban in Jumilla, in Murcia, is a first in Spain.\\nUK news | The Bank of England is poised to cut interest rates on Thursday despite a growing divide between its policymakers over the dangers to the economy from high inflation and rising unemployment.\\nEstimates of the population of undocumented migrants living in the UK range from 120,000 to 1.3 million, with Reform UK's Zia Yusuf recently putting the figure at 1.2 million.\\nRegardless, that number doesn't come close to those living in the UK legally: the 2021-22 census (pdf) put the entire foreign-born population of the UK at 10.7 million. But lies travel fast on social media – especially if they chime with existing worries or prejudice.\\nThe news last year that three girls attending a dance class in Southport were stabbed to death sent out shockwaves. As the local community gathered to mourn, a piece of disinformation – that the attacker had come to the UK on a small boat – quickly spread on social media. That sparked protests, which were very quickly exploited by far-right activists. The protests exploded, with anti-migrant rioters attacking mosques, setting fire to asylum hotels, and assaulting black and minority ethnic people.\\nIt's been a year since, but the anger has not dissipated. Instead, it is slowly hardening into a movement. Anti-immigration protests have taken place across the country and while most have remained peaceful, some have not. The BBC reported that 15 people across the country have been arrested in recent days while protesting outside hotels used to house asylum seekers.\\n“We're in what Joe Mulhall of Hope Not Hate calls the ‘post-organisational era' of the far right,” says Ben. “It's not about formal parties and memberships. It's about individuals loosely linked via social media, people who might never meet in person but have significant influence, especially on platforms like X. That all feeds into gatherings and protests, which then spill over into violence, as we saw after Southport.”\\nHe added that protests outside asylum hotels have always happened. The Bell Hotel in Epping, which has seen recent large scale protests, has actually been targeted since 2021. But these protests, once considered fringe events, are becoming a fixture.\\n“If you place Reform UK as a hard-right populist party, the groups we're seeing at the protest sit further to the right,” Ben told me. “For a while, Patriotic Alternative was the main far-right group, but it's in decline now, as a result of infighting. A newer group, Homeland Party, was set up by former far-right members and has drawn people away from Patriotic Alternative.”\\nBut he warned that we have to be careful when discussing who is involved. “They are clearly organised far-right activists who are attempting to exploit local grievances and are using misinformation to whip up feelings, but in some cases, such as Epping, the protests have included local people who are unaffiliated with organised far-right groups. There is a grey area which is difficult to determine in some cases.”\\nHe added that the big shadow over all of this is Tommy Robinson. “He's the epitome of that post-organisational far right. He's an influencer and clearly an activist, and he's got a universe of people around him, who in many cases include football hooligans.”\\nRobinson tried to amplify protests in Islington and Canary Wharf, targeting hotels thought to house asylum seekers, Ben explained. There are also other figures forming a constellation of newer far-right influencers who have attached themselves to this.\\n***\\nAre all the protesters far-right agitators?\\nWhile notable far-right figures have been spotted speaking at the protests, Ben has spoken to many who wouldn't align themselves with those groups, but are still frustrated with the country's asylum policies.\\n“It's really important to not discount the fact that people in these communities have agency of their own to go and protest and they can feel very strongly about things. They have views on the asylum system, they have views on events in the news,” Ben said.\\n“There is a debate to be had, and many media organisations will be having it, about how these protests should be described. I spoke to a local woman in Essex who said ‘we're turning up here because a teenager was allegedly sexually assaulted by a man who was in this hostel. We want to turn up and show we're not happy with this'. Are they far right purely for taking part in that protest? They would say of course not. But should they turn away from a protest when it becomes clear that it is being hijacked by neo-Nazis and far-right groups? Some would say, yes, they should.”\\n***\\nWill this weekend be a flashpoint?\\nThere is widespread reporting of a “no asylum day of action” today, but Ben believes it is not clear whether it's a real national action or a meme that has taken on a life of its own. He pointed to an incident last year where someone published a list of immigration advice centres across the country, but the protests didn't materialise.\\nThere is some evidence to show that momentum around some of these protests is beginning to slow down.\\n“It feels like the heat has come out of Epping a little bit. At the last protest, anti-racism activists and trade unionists outnumbered the protest against that hotel. And that was a place far-right activists had very clearly wanted to turn it into pilgrimage every weekend. But now it seems that perhaps the focus has shifted. It might be because lots of local people were turned off by the violence which erupted on the sidelines of those protests. But the problem is, we now have lots of others elsewhere,” Ben said.\\nThere is now widespread attention in Nuneaton because of another alleged sexual assault case there, involving a 12-year-old alleged victim. Reform council leader George Finch made comments that may be in contempt of court and have inflamed tensions, Ben said. Protests are planned at the council HQ. Other hotspots include Cannock and Waterlooville, which recently saw a thousand people protesting, he added.\\n“In places like London and Essex, anti-racist activists can mobilise very quickly in large numbers and also draw some local support and outnumber the far right. But you also have other places where there are large groups of local people who are unattached with the far right, gathering in large numbers and then you have the far right exploiting them.”\\n***\\nHow has the government responded?\\nThere has been a notable difference in the government's response to this year's protests outside asylum hotels. “After Southport, Keir Starmer called them ‘far-right riots'. He hasn't done that this time, even though the far right is heavily involved. Labour seems worried about alienating voters on immigration,” Ben said. He added that many are also critical of Starmer and Yvette Cooper for failing to condemn the racist language heard at some of these protests.\\nAnd the possibility of further national riots loom. “There's potential,” said Ben, “because we're in August. The weather's hot and rain is always one of the things that keeps people off the street. You have misinformation, the far right and others colonising local Facebook groups, with Nigel Farage and Reform amplifying many of the messages from the protests.\\n“And then you have a stretched police force as well” – stretched not only by anti-migrant protests, but by a wave of demonstrations this weekend, with hundreds expected to defy terrorism legislation to rally in support of Palestine Action. \\nThe two protests will paint a stark picture of modern Britain. On one side, police in soft caps are expected to make mass arrests, mostly of elderly people or students, with little anticipation of violence. On the other, riot vans and officers in full gear will line the streets at anti-migrant demonstrations, prepared for the possibility that unrest could erupt once again.\\nAs many as 80,000 people in Hiroshima were killed instantly when the US dropped the first nuclear bomb this week in August 1945.

An award-winning poet, a decorated army officer, and a retired head teacher are handcuffed together in the back of a police van ... It's not the start of a terrible joke, but a representation of just some of the eyebrow-raising arrests the police have made in recent weeks.\\nThese eminently establishment figures are just a few of the 700 arrested for showing support for Palestine Action after it was proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Many were in their seventies or older, and video footage made one of the mass arrests look like a giant garden party gone sour.\\nSafe to say, manhandling octogenarians is sub-optimal optics for the police. “I've never been arrested before so I'm quite nervous, actually,” said one elderly man wearing a beige blazer.\\nBut bigger shifts in policing appear to be under way. Most recently, new government guidance says police forces should look to disclose the ethnicity and migration status of suspects charged in high-profile investigations. Although this may solve one headache for the criminal justice system – stopping the spread of conspiracies about alleged offenders – it could create another by damaging race relations across the country.\\nFor today's newsletter, Rajeev Syal, home affairs editor at the Guardian, discusses the police's pivot to a more authoritarian approach to protest, the potential impacts of releasing information about race, and which voters are being wooed. That's after the headlines.\\nUkraine | Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have hailed “a visible chance for peace” in Ukraine, as long as Vladimir Putin proves he is serious about ending the war when he meets Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday.\\nEducation | Students in England gained record levels of top grades in this year's A-level exams, driven by young men producing their strongest performances outside the pandemic years.\\nGaza | More than 100 aid organisations working in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have accused Israel of “weaponising aid” in its application of rules for groups involved in delivering humanitarian assistance.\\nClimate crisis | UK firefighters have warned that 2025 is on track to beat the national record for wildfires, with frontline staff “pushed to their limits”.\\nUS news | Donald Trump cold-called Norway's finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian press reported.\\nA total of 532 people were arrested in London last Saturday at the largest demonstration in support of Palestine Action. Most of them were simply holding supportive placards or signs. Half of the people arrested were aged 60 or older, according to police figures. Nearly 100 of those detained were in their 70s and 15 were in their 80s.\\nPolice officers manning the protest were obliged to make these arrests. “It's not how one would envisage the job. And they are just doing their job,” says Rajeev Syal. “When you speak to officers privately, they know that they're not picking up thugs, they're picking up people who are motivated by politics and beliefs, and they're also peaceful. So it does certainly make police officers sit up and think.”\\nSuch events illustrate broader changes in policing driven by changing priorities in the Labour government. “I would say that this government has certainly moved towards a more authoritarian line on protests compared to previous governments,” says Rajeev.\\n“It does look as if they are pivoting towards an electorate who are less comfortable with asylum seekers in their constituencies, who are more worried about small boats coming over the sea. They know they have to win those people over in order to win a general election.”\\nThe surge in Reform UK support has made the government nervous, even though we're barely a year past an historic landslide election. Labour remain focused on so-called red wall seats dominated by white working-class voters in market, former mill and seaside towns. “Those are the places they think they've got to win people over,” explains Rajeev. \\n***\\nWhat is the logic behind revealing the racial identity of suspects?\\nIn recent days, home secretary Yvette Cooper, welcomed new police guidelines that encourage forces to release the race and nationality of those charged in high-profile cases. It comes after an independent watchdog found that failure to share basic facts about the Southport killer last summer led to “dangerous fictions” which helped spark riots across the country.\\nThe policy is designed to work on two fronts, explains Rajeev. Firstly, the government wants to stop the rise of the far right and their ability to organise through misinformation and fomenting public disorder by spreading untruths about suspects (such as the Southport case). And secondly, it sends a signal to potential Reform UK voters that the government is taking the issue of people committing crimes while applying for asylum seriously.\\n“Reform UK politicians have promoted the idea that the government and the police are involved in a cover-up of information, and this allows the government to say, ‘well we can't be',” says Rajeev. “I think there's a lot of politics involved behind some of these decisions: it's the politics of winning over Reform voters and undermining Reform in those pivotal seats that will define the next election.”\\n***\\nWhat are the criticisms of the policy?\\nThe family of Bebe King, one of the three girls killed in the Southport attack last year, have expressed their dismay at the decision. They have urged ministers to reconsider support for disclosing the ethnicity of serious crime suspects saying the information was “completely irrelevant”. The family's position is that mental health issues, and the propensity to commit crime, have nothing to do with ethnicity, nationality or race. Their argument is that such tragedies are too often used as a political football, especially by the far right.\\nCampaigners have argued it could set a dangerous precedent for “dog-whistle politics”, Rajeev says: “When a suspect involved in an alleged crime is thought to be a black or brown person, or an asylum seeker, there will be huge pressure on the Home Office from right-leaning media and on social media to release details … but there won't be as much pressure, when it's obviously a white man.”\\n“This will add to the distorted impression that minority ethnic people and refugees are responsible for a disproportionate number of crimes.”\\n***\\nWhat is the counter argument?\\nLawrence Sherman, a criminology professor from the University of Cambridge, and ex-chief scientific officer for the Met Police, disagrees that it will inflame racial tensions – he believes the opposite to be true.\\nLast summer, after false rumours spawned online about the Southport killer's foreign nationality, the police were not in a position to correct the misinformation. “I would say that was a problem with the rules,” he says. These rules have now been changed.\\nSherman believes that stating the demographic details of suspects will help with transparency. “Especially in an era of what Richard Hofstadter, the American historian, called ‘paranoid politics', in which people are always suspicious of ‘elites' trying to cover things up. Greater transparency about all these things will help to shape a dialogue around peacekeeping on one hand and proportionality on the other.”\\nAnd while the far right may be championing the changes, he cautions it may not have the result they are hoping for: “Being transparent about it will remind people that there's a lot of very violent white people in this country.”\\nAs early 2000s attitudes favouring thinness return to the fore, Lucy Knight does a deep dive interview with the unapologetic Bob Harper, personal trainer and TV personality, who hosted the controversial US show ‘The Biggest Loser'.

They want potential participants to think twice before joining,” Ben said.\\nDefend Our Juries suggests that putting its members off is unlikely, issuing a press release under the headline: “We will not be silenced.”\\n***\\nTrialed and tested tactics\\nThe tactic of mass arrests is not new in the UK. Environmentalists have used it for decades, and many of those involved with Defend Our Juries are veteran campaigners with a long history of civil disobedience.\\n“This is the same playbook as Extinction Rebellion. The idea that you force change by peaceful mass arrests, which overwhelm not just the police, but the court system as well,” Ben said.\\nHe tells me that what's new for this Saturday is that Defend Our Juries' briefing document urges people to “go floppy” and refuse to give their name and address. That means police have to take them to stations. The organisation has advised protesters not to comply with what they describe as the “charade” of street bail, where people are processed on the side of the road, bailed and told to attend a police station on another day after handing over their details and ID.\\n“So that's deliberately designed to ratchet up the pressure on the police so that there won't be enough space in all the police cells and stations in London to accommodate this number of people,” Ben said. The Met itself has admitted that these actions present “entirely unrealistic challenges” in the past, Ben added.\\nWhat happens if the police are overstretched from an action like this? “They just can't arrest people and then you've got people, in theory, breaking counter-terror laws and nobody's doing anything about it,” Ben said. “In the previous protests, there were quite a number of people not arrested even though they were holding the signs saying ‘I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action'.”\\nThese tactics are not just meant to overwhelm the police. “Other primary aims are to generate media attention and generate discussion about what's happening in Gaza and the proscription of Palestine Action.”\\n***\\nSpeaking out against the proscription\\nThe arrests at the last protest drew media attention not just because of the number of arrests, but who was arrested. They include 75-year-old Sir Jonathon Porritt, a former government official; 75-year-old Chris Romberg, a former British army officer colonel and military attache at UK embassies in Egypt and Jordan, and the son of a Holocaust survivor; and award-winning 58-year-old poet Alice Oswald.\\nThe most famous name who has come out in support of Palestine Action is award-winning and bestselling novelist Sally Rooney. The Irish novelist was due to speak at Defend our Juries' Tuesday presser before its cancellation. Last month, she pledged to use proceeds from her books, including Normal People and Conversations with Friends, along with BBC adaptations of them, to support Palestine Action.\\n“Questions now arise about whether she'd feel safe coming to Britain, given her public support for Palestine Action,” Ben told me. “And Amnesty International is running an international campaign against the proscription, so the government is under pressure on multiple fronts.”\\nOthers to criticise the proscription include the former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who warned the UK government was “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine Action.\\n“The more interesting thing in some ways is whether Labour backbenchers themselves have started having second thoughts about the proscription, and whether enough of them might want to apply some pressure as well,” Ben said.\\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy co-wrote an opinion piece with Hain calling for a review of terrorism legislation following Palestine Action arrests. That call was later echoed by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey.\\n***\\nUnder pressure\\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has shown no sign of retreat on her decision to proscribe Palestine Action, while Defend our Juries hopes to ramp up the pressure to the point the law is unworkable and she is forced to resign.\\nIs there an off-ramp? Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori has been allowed to bring an unprecedented legal challenge to the home secretary's decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws. If Ammori wins, it would throw the arrests and charges into chaos.\\nAt the heart of the high court's decision to allow the challenge were cases of police overreach. One was that of Laura Murton, who the Guardian revealed had been threatened with arrest by armed officers for holding a sign saying “Free Gaza” and a Palestinian flag. Since then, Ben has reported on the case of Miles Pickering, who was arrested for wearing a T-shirt reading “Plasticine Action.”\\n“The police apparently misread it at the time of his arrest. Only after he arrived at Scotland Yard did they realise the mistake, which shows the very difficult position the police are in with these tactics,” Ben said.\\nWhile the legal challenge could provide an off-ramp for Palestine Action and the government, it would feel like a humiliating defeat for the latter.\\n“It would be a massive embarrassment if Cooper loses this legal challenge,” Ben said. “Cooper would have been the person at the forefront of proscribing Palestine Action, so you can imagine calls for her to resign.”\\nHe explained that Amori's lawyers have already warned Cooper about her language, namely on the group being violent. There's also been pushback against Labour ministers suggesting Palestine Action targets Jewish businesses, while Palestine Action insist its actions have been against Israeli arms companies, not Jewish businesses.\\nIn another twist in the legal battle, the Home Office won permission to try to block Palestine Action's attempt to overturn its ban under terror laws.\\nThere are other challenges for the protesters too, Ben added. Can they keep up the momentum? How many more people are willing to be arrested and charged with terror offences?\\nWe will find out on Saturday.\\nThis is a damning video experiment from Neelam Tailor who set up teenager TikTok accounts and found that within minutes the female profile was bombarded with eating disorder content, while the male account was bombarded by misogyny.

Lucy Mangan\\nMusicCMAT: Euro-Country | ★★★★★Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson (CMAT) unites two of the mid-2020s' most pervasive cultural trends: the so-called “green wave” of zeitgeist-dominating Irish actors, authors and musicians, and the irreverent embrace of country music by pop stars such as Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey and Chappell Roan. Even the most conventional song on Euro-Country, the cool R&B-pop of Running/Planning, is laden with bonkers lyrics about creating an imaginary boyfriend, ripping his head off and then promising to buy said head a Nintendo and “all the games”. It is exceptional because of how Thompson constantly strives – sometimes wryly, sometimes earnestly, always entertainingly – to capture messy psychological entrails that don't fit the template of the typical pop song.

         "[\"Images of Palestinian children in Gaza, emaciated by hunger under the blockade imposed by Israel, and of families grieving the more than 61,000 people killed in the territory have stirred outrage among foreign governments and much of the global public. Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly different.\\nIn a poll conducted in late July by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering among Gaza's Palestinian population.\\nAccording to Anat Saragusti, an expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware of those reports because for months they have never seen them.\\n“Until a couple of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what's going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at all.”\\nIn the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas, and the country's military goals in Gaza. In that climate, the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas's attacks – although polls also show a clear majority want a deal with Hamas to end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.\\nMedia analysts say Israel's main broadcasters have largely embraced the narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country's history.\\nFor months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed up by Benjamin Netanyahu's claim last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAccording to UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza is going for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation.\\n“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.\\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.\\nEven Donald Trump, Netanyahu's key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue, said: “I don't know … those children look very hungry … that's real starvation stuff.”  \\nIn a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza and dismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack Israel.\\nHe compared these images with a photograph of the Israeli hostage Evyatar David released by the Palestinian militant group early in August, pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death, the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular. The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the public of Gaza.\\nSaragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership, insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAlthough Israel appears to exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recently filled the streets of Tel Aviv are now urging the government to halt the atrocities against the Palestinians.\\n“I think it is horrendous what is happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.”\\nGal Alkalay, 28, said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of our hostages.”\\nAnd yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals using the word “genocide” to describe their government's actions in Gaza – as the award-winning author David Grossman did just a fortnight ago – analysts say they remain a small minority.\\nIn Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align themselves with the narrative of Israel's political leadership.\\n\\nCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.\\nIsrael has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other restrictions include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.\\nPalestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over 180 killed since the conflict began.\\nThe committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.\\nForeign reporters based in Israel filed a legal petition seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by prominent journalists and media outlets have been ignored by the Israeli government.\\nTo ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual\\u200b\\u200b teams verif\\u200by photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.\\nEmma Graham-Harrison,\\xa0chief\\xa0Middle East correspondent\\n\\nAsked what she thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34, said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the security of our country.”\\nZalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas's ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the whole world's face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.”\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.\\nReporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have formally called for Gaza to be opened to foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.\\nMany argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the narrative.\\n“The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists, who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation but doesn't let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is starvation or not.”\\nUp to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded very well in its goal”.\", \"Good morning. Tony Blair is back and he has plans for the Middle East.\\nNo, you have not woken up and jumped back two decades in time. The former Labour leader, who was put under pressure to resign after the disastrous decision to go to war with Iraq – which led to the death of a million Iraqis and created a vacuum later filled by the brutal Islamic State – is back in the headlines this week.\\nBlair has attended a White House meeting with Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, according to recent reports.\\nThe former British prime minister has been working on a proposal for several months for the governance in Gaza after the war ends. The 72-year-old has reportedly been doing so with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, and the Emirati foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed.\\nWho appears to be missing from this roundtable on who will govern Palestinians in Gaza? The Palestinians themselves. While reporting suggests Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was briefed, there is little indication that Palestinians have any real say.\\nBut Palestinians are not voiceless as our current leaders often imply. Nor must they remain at the mercy of those more powerful. They also have their own plan for a postwar Gaza. To understand what leaders of Palestinian civil society are calling for, and what drives their continuing struggle for self-determination, I spoke to Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development and member of the steering committee of the Palestinian NGO Network. He is based in Ramallah. That's after the headlines.\\nUkraine | The UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged British Council and EU offices.\\nUK news | The Treasury is reportedly considering a tax on landlords in the autumn budget that would target income from rents. The proposals are centred on the expansion of national insurance to include rental income.\\nIran | The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites.\\nUS news | The White House named non-scientist Jim O'Neill, a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, to serve as acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid a standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez whose lawyers said she could only be removed by Donald Trump himself.\\nEnvironment | The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact.\\nAfter stepping down as UK prime minister in 2007, Tony Blair served as the UN Middle East envoy until 2015. He spent years visiting Jerusalem pushing for a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, but there was no resolution, nor any meaningful development towards a Palestinian state.\\nDetails of the plans being discussed by Blair, the US and Israeli officials remain scarce for now.\\nThe far right in Israel remains animated by a proposal announced in February, weeks after Donald Trump was elected, in which the US president effectively called for Gaza to be ethnically cleansed, the land seized by the US, and an international resort built. The “Gaza Riviera” plan was widely condemned, including by western-backed Arab allies. Trump has been a lot quieter on this plan since.\\nIn July, reports emerged that Blair's thinktank worked with a project developing a postwar Gaza plan that included the creation of a “Trump Riviera” and a manufacturing zone named after Elon Musk. The project was led by Israeli business people using financial models developed by the US firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) said it was not involved in the authorship of the plan but two staff members took part in calls as the project evolved. BCG has distanced itself significantly from the work in Gaza, reportedly firing two partners who it said had misled senior management.\\n“There is not a single Palestinian at the table” in these reported discussions, Ubai Al-Aboudi told me, “whether it's the Palestinian political leadership or representatives of Palestinian civil society and the wider Palestinian communities.” \\nHe added: “This is colonial practice. Palestinians must decide their own governance and future. But instead, while we are being genocided, the same powers complicit in the genocide are planning our future.”\\n***\\nWhat Palestinians want\\nAl-Aboudi dismissed Blair not only as a war criminal who must answer for the horrors that unfolded in Iraq, but for his role as the Middle Eastern envoy, “which failed in reining in Israel's policies of fragmentation, of, increased settlement activity, increased human rights violations against Palestinians, increased economic dependency of Palestinians”.\\nFrom the early days of the war in Gaza, Palestinian civil society has emphasised that any governance or rebuilding must have Palestinian agency at its core, Al-Aboudi explained, which factors in Palestinian cultural, historical, and socioeconomic heritage.\\n“It should take into account that 80% of the people living in Gaza, for example, are refugees whose fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed from their villages back in 1948. It should take into account that there should be unity between the West Bank and Gaza, and it should take into account that the Israeli system of control over Palestinians cannot continue and should not be allowed or maintained. No Israeli should have a say or a call on the future of any Palestinian; this should be the number one lesson from this genocide,” Al-Aboudi said. “What's happening right now is totally different. Palestinian voices are being totally ignored. The Palestinian narrative is being erased.”\\nHe said Palestinian civil society embraced the Egypt plan for Gaza, which was backed by the Arab league and Europe, which would rebuild Gaza and support Palestinian technocrats, operating under the management of the Palestinian Authority (PA), to take over Gaza's governance. The plan, which includes elections, would eventually lead to Gaza and the West Bank coming together as part of a Palestinian state.\\n“We have called for … a democratically elected leadership that would guide our people towards freedom … that would lift up our people. Unfortunately, all of these calls have fallen on deaf ears, whether from the international community or the US,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe denial of Palestinian autonomy\\nLife for Palestinians in the West Bank means being trapped between a rock and a hard place: the Israeli occupation on one side and a Palestinian Authority that works with it on the other.\\nAl-Aboudi's organisation, Bisan, works to secure socioeconomic rights for Palestinians and to advocate on their behalf “not just against Israeli occupation but also the Palestinian Authority and big business when they violate people's rights”.\\n“Our work has put us in the crosshairs of everyone. I've been arrested by both Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian Authority. Our organisation has been targeted, but we're still operational, pushing for the basic right of Palestinians to live in dignity.”\\nBut even the western-backed PA, widely criticised by many Palestinians for its role in working closely with the Israeli occupation, has been excluded from discussions about Gaza's future. That's largely down to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli ministers who have firmly ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza.\\n“What we have now is a propped-up dictator, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected in 2005 for a four-year period that has now stretched for more than 20 years. He has been kept in power by outside support, not popular support. And now, even this propped-up leadership is not being consulted on what kind of leadership or governance should exist; let alone … the Palestinian community itself, the people who are going through the genocide right now,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe work continues\\nFor Al-Aboudi, the denial of Palestinian agency has been a process that has unfolded over many decades.\\nIn 2021, Israel designated Bisan Centre and five other human rights organisations in the occupied territories as terrorists. This was widely rebuffed by the international community.\\n“Israel has always worked to stifle any kind of Palestinian agency … We have always been subjected to Israeli harassment.” But he explained that the sucker punch was landed when the Israeli government designated Bisan under the same label as al-Qaida and Islamic State. “Can you imagine that? Civil society organisations that write reports, provide aid for people, provide legal counselling, communicate to the world, to the UN, what is happening here, are being treated in the same way as IS?” Al-Aboudi said.\\nYet the work continues. “We believe in every human being in the world. We believe in equality, we believe in dignity, and we believe our people deserve it like any other people around the world.”\\nWith the Palestinians living amid one of their darkest chapters in their history, I asked Al-Aboudi why he still holds on to hope.\\n“This is the only thing that keeps us going … When we see millions of people on the streets of London or Manchester, or in Sydney, Australia … this gives us hope. We know that righteousness is on our side. We know that the people of the world feel for what we are going through,” he said.\\nAnd, he added, that regardless of what is being planned in backrooms, he ultimately believes that political agency will, at the end of the day, lie with the people. “The people have the power, and the people can claim back their political agency from corrupt governments and businesses.”\\nPatrick Greenfield has a fascinating look at the genuinely serious work of tackling invasive hornets threatening UK pollinators.

After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete picture of the event. This documentary series on iPlayer, copes with the challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform's layout to give us the fullest picture possible. The shocking story is skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors' words, as the actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their experience. Jack Seale\\nMusicBlood Orange: Essex Honey | ★★★★★This is an exquisitely eclectic portrait of grief. It combines gorgeous melodies with dancefloor rhythms, indie pop and languorous funk – and cameos from Lorde and Zadie Smith. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there's a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes's mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London's urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on countryside. Alexis Petridis\\nFilmIn the Nguyen Kitchen | ★★★★☆In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen. A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can't help but dream in songs. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Phuong Le\\nTheatreJuniper Blood (Donmar Warehouse, London) | ★★★☆☆Mike Bartlett's invigorating play is a drama about whether it is possible to live responsibly in our age of toxic capitalism. It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.

That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.” \\nLate on Tuesday, a senior UN official warned that expanding Israeli military operations inside the territory “would risk catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza”.\\nAddressing the UN security council in New York, Miroslav Jenča, the assistant secretary general for Europe, central Asia and the Americas, said: “There is no military solution to the conflict in Gaza or the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”\\nChina's deputy UN representative, Geng Shuang, expressed “great concern” about the reported plans for Gaza and added: “We urge Israel to immediately halt such dangerous actions.” He called for a ceasefire and urged countries with influence to take concrete steps to help bring one about.\\nIsrael's scorched-earth campaign has obliterated large parts of Gaza, killed more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forced nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people from their homes and created what a global hunger monitor last week called an unfolding famine.\\nThat has caused widespread international anger and prompted the UK to say it would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against Israel. Several other European countries including Portugal and Finland have recently signed a statement declaring their willingness to recognize the state of Palestine as an essential step towards a two-state solution.\\nThe disquiet follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion.\\n“The die has been cast. We're going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu.\\nBy Tuesday, however, evidence had emerged of deep splits between Netanyahu and senior military officials, including the chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who reportedly voiced opposition to the plan, prompting calls for his dismissal.\\nAbsent at a security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu did, however, meet security officials, but not in a decision-making setting. His office said later that the Israeli military would carry out any decision made in cabinet. \\nDuring a visit to an army training facility earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “It is necessary to complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, to free all our hostages and to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.”\\nMilitary analysts in the Israeli media, channelling some defence officials, were also sceptical. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the military affairs commentator Yossi Yehoshua described the risks of the proposal. “Hostages … will die, large numbers of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers will be killed as well as a serious logistical problem – where to house the roughly 1 million civilians who are now in Gaza City.\\n“Currently, Israel simply doesn't have legitimacy either to continue to fight in Gaza or to establish a city of refugees on its ruins.”\\nIsraeli officials have said Netanyahu discussed a plan with the White House as it attempted to portray Hamas as having walked away from ceasefire negotiations, a claim denied by Hamas, which blamed Israel for the protracted impasse.\\nWhile the Trump administration has not commented on the Netanyahu proposal, it has been given some credence by leaked comments made by the US envoy Steve Witkoff to Israeli hostage families at the weekend, suggesting his proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining living hostages had failed.\\nWitkoff added that Donald Trump “now believes that everybody should come home at once. No piecemeal deals,” adding they were now pursuing an “all or nothing” plan.\\nAt the centre of the Netanyahu plan is the notion that, by surrounding areas where hostages are believed to be held, Israeli forces can raid those areas and rescue the captives, a policy that has broadly failed during the past two years of war.\\nAmid questions over the practicality of a wider offensive, some have speculated that Netanyahu's call may be more rhetorical than real in substance, aimed at keeping onboard far-right ministers who have demanded they be allowed to build settlements in Gaza.\\nA Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.\\n“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” the official told Reuters, requesting not to be named.\\nPractically, too, it is unclear whether Israel has the capacity for the kind of expanded operation described.\\nThe IDF has struggled with manpower issues as the war drags on, with reservists being repeatedly called up amid concerns over a mental health crisis that has included a number of suicides.\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"Good morning. Parliament has returned from its summer recess. MPs are filing back into those hallowed halls to resume the business of running the country. Have you missed them? Judging by polling on trust in politicians, the answer from many of you is likely a resounding no.\\nFor most MPs, the summer recess is a chance to pause and reset. Not so for Reform UK. The insurgent party, which has just four MPs, spent the summer working the country like it was in the middle of a general election campaign. It has been hard to escape Nigel Farage (pictured top) and Reform: the party has held at least five press conferences since recess began (with another scheduled for today). There has also been a flurry of statements and open letters, and record-breaking polling to top it all off. Reform returns to parliament riding high.\\nThe ball is now in Labour's court. With a packed autumn schedule, the government has an opportunity to reset the news cycle and seize the political agenda. But, just because it can, does not mean that it will.\\nLabour has been widely criticised for failing to articulate a message that cuts through in its first year in power. Can that change this autumn? What challenges lie ahead and where might the party finally break through? To explore all this and more, I spoke to the Guardian's political editor, Pippa Crerar. That's after the headlines.\\nAfghanistan | At least 250 people were dead and hundreds more injured in a magnitude 6 earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. The quake was centred 27km north-east of the city of Jalalabad.\\nIsrael-Gaza war | Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 18 people in and around Gaza City, local health authorities said, as Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet prepared to discuss plans to seize the city.\\nConservatives | Doubts have surfaced over Kemi Badenoch's claim to have been offered a place at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to recall the proposal and the university not providing the course.\\nUK news | A police officer was allegedly punched in the face and four people were arrested at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday.\\nHeart disease | Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines worldwide.\\nLabour did not head into summer recess from a position of strength. The party was forced into a humiliating retreat over its welfare reform bill after a dramatic backbench rebellion. After weeks of bruising infighting, many in Labour felt the summer break offered a chance to cool tempers and rethink. They may come to regret that.\\n“They could have managed to allow everyone a break without vacating the public arena for Reform and they may rue the day that they allowed Reform to set the agenda,” Pippa Crerar told me. “It makes it harder now to refute the claims that they don't have a grip on migration and it means that they have to think quite carefully about how to get back on to the front foot.”\\nStill, the Labour government is determined to wrest back control, and they will have plenty of opportunity to do so: with a packed autumn of domestic challenges and international crises, the public will be looking to hear directly from those in power.\\n“Whether they managed to get the positive message that they want to get across is a totally different question and obviously a much harder feat. People I've spoken to in Downing Street and in government suggest that they understand they need to do that, and there's a degree of frustration that delivery's not fast enough and the messaging isn't coherent enough,” Pippa said.\\nThere has been a flurry of reports that Keir Starmer (pictured above) is preparing a minor reshuffle of his government, alongside changes to his Downing Street team.\\n“Ultimately, the buck stops with the person at the top,” Pippa said. “And if the person at the top isn't able to articulate why they want to be in government and what they want to achieve in a way that resonates with ordinary people, it's a struggle.”\\nSo what problems lie ahead for the government, at home and on the international stage? \\n***\\nThe domestic challenges …\\nRecent polling makes for an uncomfortable read for Labour supporters. The party enjoyed little in the way of a honeymoon period, with figures showing its ratings have fallen further in the first 10 months of government than those of any other party in modern history.\\nBut Pippa told me that the polling, which has been brutal for the Conservatives as well, shows widespread discontent with mainstream politics generally.\\n“Reform is doing so well because it capitalises on that discontent, it becomes a vehicle for the disillusionment which many people have in the mainstream political parties,” Pippa said. “And Farage is an extraordinary communicator who manages to tap into people's fears, just as he did with Brexit, to provide answers that I would argue exacerbates them, particularly with migration.”\\nOn migration, Labour are breathing a sigh of relief to have won an appeal to continue using hotels to house asylums seekers, but the fight is far from over. The party are working to reduce the asylum backlog, having announced their agreement of a one in, one out deal with the French, but it's slow work, Pippa explained. For MPs in marginal seats, particularly around the “red wall”, they fear migration is the issue that could cost them unless the government is tougher.\\nThe European convention on human rights (ECHR) is the new battleground, with Farage describing it as such. “Downing Street has made it absolutely clear that the UK was not going to leave the ECHR, because it would be hugely problematic for things like trade deals and, crucially, the Good Friday agreement,” Pippa said. But the government has announced a review of article 8 (respect for your private and family life) of the EHRC and possibly article 3 (protecting you from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), as there are arguments that their scope is too wide and they are preventing the deportation of convicted foreign criminals.\\nThere's a broader debate on whether the UK should work with European Union member states on more general reforms of the ECHR as a whole.\\nThe other big domestic challenge is the economy. “Rachel Reeves is ending the summer in a worse position than she started,” Pippa said, with inflation remaining high, many still struggling with the cost of living crisis, and the Office for Budget Responsibility now thinking of revising its forecast in light of an outdated measure of productivity.\\n“The problem it creates for Reeves, and the reason I think we are likely to see the budget potentially pushed back into November from October, is that they're trying to work out the communications on it. They have boxed themselves in. They said that they are not going to borrow any more and they said that they don't want to be a government that cuts spending. Well, that only leaves them with tax rises,” Pippa said.\\n***\\n… And the international upheavals\\nThe problem for Starmer is that his international popularity isn't translating much domestically. But why is his reputation better among international audiences? Pippa told me Starmer has built a reputation for being effective in difficult situations with international partners.\\n“The big international moment coming up in the next month is Donald Trump's state visit. And, as we saw when Trump was on a holiday in Scotland, he has this capacity to whirl into town and stir everything up and then disappear again. He's a very unpredictable president,” Pippa said.\\nDespite Trump's promises to end the war in Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin has continued ordering attacks (including a deadly assault on Kyiv last week). And the Alaska summit didn't deliver what Ukraine and its European partners wanted, Pippa said.\\nOn Gaza, Starmer has promised to recognise Palestine as a state, after being urged to do so by his cabinet and the wider Labour movement. But as the devastation continues in Gaza and the siege is tightened across the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories, pressure grows on Starmer to go further, with growing calls for further sanctions.\\n“They've already sanctioned the two far right members of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet. We could well see more to come,” Pippa said. “The government has certainly indicated that they would be prepared to take further steps and sanction not only just politicians but also senior Israeli military, if they think that they've been directly responsible for some of their atrocities in Gaza.”\\n***\\nAn existential moment for Keir Starmer\\nStarmer clearly drew out the battle line when he labelled Reform as the main opposition to his government. But over the last few months there has been a real risk of Starmer being defined by Farage. So how will Labour respond?\\n“The big danger is that personal attacks on Farage put the spotlight on him and give him a platform. By defining him as the opposition, it cuts the Tories off at the knees, but it also risks putting Reform UK in a better position,” Pippa said. “If the government sees Reform as a potential government in waiting, then presumably the public may as well.”\\nAnd we saw this summer what happens when Farage is left unchallenged. “They will take the fight to him.,” Pippa said of Labour. But whether they do that by moving in to Reform UK's terrain, or by managing to make the case for their own agenda based on Labour values and on what Starmer believes in will be the interesting thing to watch, she added.\\nThe problem for voters is that many just don't know what the PM stands for. “Starmer has struggled to articulate what he believes in, so this is an existential moment if they can't turn the tide away from Reform UK and can't convince people that Labour can actually deliver,” Pippa said, pointing to next May's local elections, as well as votes in Wales and Scotland, as critical moments. And, by next summer, Labour will be halfway through its parliamentary term.\\nBut, Pippa added, Reform's lead in the polls does not make an election win a foregone conclusion, and Labour still have time on their side. She described Reform's policies as vague and contradictory. While Farage has been able to capitalise on exploiting social and racial divisions, many British people may not feel comfortable with the direction he represents.\\n“We live in incredibly volatile times,” Pippa said, “But it does definitely still feel like there's everything to play for for Labour”.\\nUnfortunate enough to have heard about the “performative male”, the internet's new least favourite type of guy?

Until tomorrow.\\nQuick crossword\\nCryptic crossword\\nWordiply\", \"Good morning. Angela Rayner's decision to step down will be a gut punch for the prime minister, who went out of his way to defend her.\\nIt was an unlikely political marriage – while Keir Starmer is known for his sober style, Rayner is emotionally open and forthright. But for that reason it was also a union that Starmer desperately relied on, and it leaves a gaping hole for Labour.\\nAside from dealing with the fallout and subsequent big cabinet reshuffle, Starmer's in-tray is already full, with his break this summer in Europe probably already feeling like a decade ago.\\nLabour has been bruised by its failure to get to grips with the surging threat from the far right (stoked by Nigel Farage over the summer) and is struggling to put forward a credible plan for the economy. I spoke to Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee about thorns in Starmer's side: losing Rayner, his inability to get Farage off his heels, and what to do about the country's finances at the upcoming budget. That's after the headlines.\\nPolitics | Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, will host a meeting of the Five Eyes security alliance to discuss how to stop people-smuggling.\\nUK news | Almost 900 people were arrested at a demonstration in central London on Saturday against the banning of the protest group Palestine Action.\\nUkraine | Russia has launched its largest ever air attack on Ukraine, hitting a key government building in Kyiv for the first time and killing at least three people.\\nAustralia | Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 33 years after murdering three people and attempting to murder a fourth with a lunch laced with death cap mushrooms.\\nNew Zealand| A fugitive father who had been hiding in New Zealand's rugged wilderness with his three children for nearly four years has been shot dead by police investigating an armed burglary in which a police officer was shot and badly wounded.\\nOn Friday Rayner resigned after the prime minister's ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code over her underpayment of stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat. Her departure leaves the government without one of its most authentic working-class voices at a time when it is struggling to reconnect with its traditional voter base. In what is likely to prove a bittersweet moment, her workers' rights bill is due to pass its final stage soon.\\nRayner has been an emblem of social mobility. “It's an absolute tragedy for Labour to lose her,” says Polly Toynbee. “She was representative of something quite different in the cabinet – not just that she's working class because this is a very working-class cabinet – but the way she came up without a university education, unmarried mother of a disabled child aged 16. Her backstory is so extraordinary. But more than that, she was such a blazingly bright character. You would see her singing and dancing at party conferences. She was fun, she was human, and she was full of indignation about injustices of every kind.”\\nRayner was the first to pile the pressure on Conservative party chair Nadhim Zahawi when the issue over his tax affairs was first revealed in 2023. She did the same with Jeremy Hunt in 2018. “The trouble is, that's what's done it for her, because there are so many quotes of her being outraged by the rich not paying their taxes, or other people not playing the game fairly. That's really finished her off. What she's done herself – whether it was by accident or on purpose, who knows – is a complete calamity,” says Polly.\\nStarmer has been told by senior Labour figures he must stop making mistakes. The mood within the party is “pretty ferocious” after achieving a stonking great majority with nothing in its way, and then such an appalling first year, says Polly. Rayner's departure sparked a big cabinet reshuffle, with David Lammy made deputy prime minister and Yvette Cooper made foreign secretary. Only a handful of cabinet ministers stayed in the same job (including Wes Streeting at health and Rachel Reeves as chancellor).\\nThe number of cabinet changes suggests the extent of worry, with a feeling that there needed to be a complete reset within No 10, with Labour continuing to disappoint in the polls as Reform UK's successes pile up (although a No 1 single may yet elude them). \\nOn a personal level, Starmer was clearly sad to see Rayner go and said in his response to her resignation letter that she had been “a true friend for many years”. He said: “I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievements in politics.” The letter was, unusually, written by hand.\\n***\\nManaging the surge from the right\\nA YouGov poll last month put Labour on just 20% of public approval, eight points behind Reform UK and its lowest level in more than five years. While everyone else was on sunloungers for summer recess, Farage spotted an opportunity to get some attention with a series of press conferences for journalists hungry for news, whipping up anger about the rising number of small boat crossings, and hotels housing asylum seekers.\\nPolly says the public's appetite to reduce immigration will never be fully sated. “I think there will always be some people who want more and more foreigners out, and it comes and goes in waves.” But Farage doesn't have much else to campaign on, said Polly.\\nAnd his ideas don't generally hold under scrutiny. For example, when asked for clarification on his pledge to pay the Taliban for taking shipments of refugees, he changed the subject. And speaking at the Reform UK conference in Birmingham, Farage declared he will run on a pledge to “stop the boats” within two weeks of entering No 10, which he quickly rowed back on.\\nMuch to the discomfort of the left, immigration is now considered one of the most important issues for voters – which is why getting a grip on Britain's borders, and showing visible progress on this issue, is one of the most pressing things in Starmer's in-tray. Farage was eager to trumpet a general election in 2027 – although something truly extraordinary would need to happen for that to occur given the size of Labour's majority.\\nFollowing Reform UK's conference over the weekend, the government made announcements about speeding up the closure of asylum hotels and suspending refugee family reunions. Starmer has been criticised for peddling populist narratives, recently warning that Britain had become an “island of strangers” – though later blaming his Enoch Powell-esque language on his speechwriters.\\nPolly says Starmer needs to completely change tack and attack Farage's views, rather than placating him. “In every speech, he has to go for his racism, he has to go for his stirring up race hatred and hatred against foreigners, the terrible incidents of people being attacked, like the deputy leader of the Greens, on the beach at Cromer, with his family of Asian origin having bottles and insults thrown at them.”\\nPopulations are declining across Europe, projections show, creating economic shocks and slower growth, which will be exacerbated without immigration. So Polly says Starmer should make a stronger case for the benefits of immigration.\\n“We need these people. Look around you and you see how much we need migrants with the skills that we need … you can turn it into a different conversation,” she says.\\n***\\nCan Starmer win economic credibility?\\nA major political event this autumn is the budget.\\nIt has already been delayed, sparking speculation about the size of the fiscal deficit and how it can be plugged, with Rachel Reeves acknowledging that the UK economy is “not working well enough for working people”. She said: “Bills are high. Getting ahead feels tougher. You put more in, get less out. That has to change.”\\nExperts suggest the spending gap is likely to reach more than £40bn after sluggish economic growth and higher-than-expected inflation. Reeves has already ruled out putting up income tax, national insurance or VAT, in order to stick with her manifesto pledges. Options include increasing inheritance tax and raising capital gains tax on expensive homes.\\nCoupled with her struggle to explain tax rises to the public, she also needs to improve public services. She must manage demands for higher pay for public sector staff, deal with the doctors' strike and oversee the phase-out of NHS England.\\nOne option in her arsenal would be to “remind citizens that their taxes pay for things that we value”, says Polly.\\n“[They should] say, look, if you want public services that are up to standard, you have to pay for them. There is no free lunch. These are hard times right across Europe. Donald Trump has made them much worse … When it comes to it, I know most of the people in this country would rather have a health service, local council services that work and pay a bit more tax, than to have tax cuts and threadbare services on their knees,” she says.\\nOf course, the party might be afraid of big business, but as Polly says: “There's no point in trying to do quite ‘left' things and sort of whispering about it. Business is never going to like Labour very much, but I think there would be more respect if they spell out what they're about and why.”\\nThe tendency of some landlords to police their tenants' behaviour is well documented, but adverts from prospective flatmates stipulating absurd house-sharing rules are increasingly common and speak to something deeper about rising housing inequality.

Fortunately, we in the UK couldn't wish for a better-qualified prime minister to face this challenge. Keir Starmer is a distinguished former human rights lawyer and prosecutor, with a 30-year career behind him, who expresses a deep personal commitment to defending ordinary people against injustice. He knows human rights law inside out – in fact, he literally wrote the book on its European incarnation – and has acted as a lawyer at more or less every level of the system. (Starmer is the only British prime minister, and probably the only world leader, to have argued a case under the genocide convention – against Serbia on behalf of Croatia in 2014 – at the international court of justice.) He is also an experienced administrator, through his time as director of public prosecutions (DPP), which means he knows how to operate the machinery of state better than most politicians do.\\nUnfortunately, there's someone standing in Starmer's way: a powerful man who critics say is helping to weaken the international human rights system. He fawns over authoritarian demagogues abroad and is seeking to diminish the protections the UK offers to some vulnerable minorities. He conflates peaceful, if disruptive, protest with deadly terrorism and calls for musicians whose views and language he dislikes to be dropped from festival bills. At times, he uses his public platform to criticise courts, whose independence is vital to maintaining the human rights system. At others, he uses legal sophistry to avoid openly stating and defending his own political position, including on matters of life and death. He is, even some of his admirers admit, a ruthless careerist prepared to jettison his stated principles when politically expedient. That person is also called Keir Starmer.\\nSince the 2024 general election, much ink has been spilled on what Labour is getting wrong in government. But I've been puzzled by a slightly different question: why is Labour's record to date on human rights – the one thing you might expect a Starmer-led government to be rock solid on – so mixed? Over the past six months, I have spoken to more than two dozen sources, including current and former Labour insiders, former legal colleagues of Starmer's and leading human rights advocates, to try to understand how Starmer the lawyer might be shaping Starmer the prime minister.\\nSome human rights experts are delighted that, after the scorched-earth years of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, there has been a shift in tone and content. “It is a major achievement,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics and long-term acquaintance of Starmer, “to have stabilised Britain's commitment to law at a time when the current is flowing the other way internationally.” For the author, barrister and academic Philippe Sands, a prominent critic of the 2003 Iraq war, the UK is belatedly restoring a reputation it shredded two decades ago. “When I've gone to meetings in the UN, when I've gone to meetings in the Council of Europe, I've seen that Britain is once more taken seriously in relation to building a more positive agenda on human rights.” Sands is particularly encouraged by Labour's commitment to setting up a special tribunal for Russian war crimes in Ukraine, despite the US's wavering support. Such achievements, Sands and Gearty believe, are in no small part down to Starmer himself. “He does well in a crisis,” says a senior barrister who worked on several cases with Starmer in the 2000s. “That's what litigators do: they enter the fray at the moment of complete crisis and shitshow.”\\nOthers, to put it mildly, aren't so keen. Before the election, Starmer told a meeting of Iranian women activists that a Labour government would put human rights at the heart of everything it did. “That's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard,” says a campaigner at a UK charity who regularly meets with ministers and officials. The campaigner reeled off a list of complaints, from policies on migration, policing and protest, to disability benefit cuts and a failure to push harder for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Some former colleagues are shocked that Starmer presides over all this. “Given he made his career off a woman who constantly scaled the fences of US bases,” says the criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, referring to Lindis Percy, a veteran peace activist Starmer represented several times in the 1990s and 00s, “what he's doing on protest is particularly sickening.”\\nStaff at several human rights NGOs described encountering a brittle, defensive attitude from ministers in private meetings. “They think the human rights community should put up and shut up,” said one. “There's a tone as if our agenda is against the interests of UK citizens,” said another, who focuses on international issues. “The line that comes back is that this is irrelevant to ordinary people's concerns.” All said that this attitude emanated most strongly from officials working for the prime minister, an interpretation echoed by two people familiar with cabinet-level conversations. Several human rights advocates described being made to feel they should just be grateful it was Labour and not the Tories in charge.\\nHow to explain, then, what Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, described to me as this “split personality approach”? Some government insiders complain about a lack of overall strategy and an insular, macho “boys' club” surrounding Starmer – frequent criticisms of Labour in recent months – while the human rights advocates I spoke to say some officials are inexperienced. Much of the answer, however, surely resides with Starmer himself, and his own ambiguous politics.\\nThere are three Starmer biographies to date, each with a very different perspective. One is a critique from the left, one from the right and one, with his input, very positive. Yet all three books tell roughly the same story. Starmer started off on the radical left, as a talented young barrister, but tacked towards the centre as his career progressed and his political ambitions grew, becoming DPP – helping run what a former colleague described to me as “the really nasty parts of the state” – before entering politics.\\nAs an MP, he ran for Labour leader on a leftwing platform and then moved sharply rightwards; depending on your political preference, either a smart strategic move, or what Simon Fletcher, who was a senior adviser to Starmer in his first year as leader of the opposition, told me he now views as a “massive, massive con”. He eschews ideology – “there's no such thing as Starmerism and there never will be. I will make decisions one after the other,” Starmer reportedly told colleagues while leader of the opposition – and his detail-focused lawyer's mind leads him to make effective, short-term tactical choices, but also blinds him to the wider consequences of his actions.\\n“He can be very tunnel-visioned,” concedes the senior barrister who praised his skills in a crisis, adding that on occasion it leads Starmer the politician to make statements that any lawyer would find “frankly, weird”. (Starmer's assertion during an interview in October 2023 that Israel “has the right” to cut off water and electricity to Gaza – acts that are clearly war crimes – and his subsequent backtracking is the notorious example.) This pattern has continued into government. “He keeps blindsiding people,” says the head of one UK charity, pointing to the sudden decision in February to cut international aid. (“That really was a case of, ‘Oh shit, we need to find £2bn for defence,'” one government official told me.)\\nThis isn't just about Starmer, though. Human rights represent an idea with revolutionary implications: that we all have the right to freedom and dignity, wherever we live, and that it is everyone's business to make sure of it. This goal is yet to be fully realised and the project to achieve it is riven with contradictions – the same contradictions, in fact, that we find in the two faces of Starmer. “Is he the man to save the system?” asks another former colleague. “That depends on what you think the system is.”\\nIn 2020, Starmer told Desert Island Discs what had attracted him to human rights as a law student in the 1980s. “I became absolutely fascinated with the idea that at the end of the second world war, and the atrocities of the second world war, the countries around the world came together and made commitments to each other to honour human rights,” he said. “It's not so much the individual rights, but it's the human dignity that sits behind [them].”\\nNow, is that a radical sentiment, or a conservative one? In a way, it's both. A tension within the human rights project is that it cuts across traditional political distinctions of left and right. The founding principles, outlined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stress both individual freedom and socioeconomic equality. What's more, human rights have an ambiguous relationship to the state. On the one hand, the claim that rights exist due to our common humanity, no matter who's in charge, implies a challenge to established power. On the other, it reinforces existing power structures – since the human rights system only works if national governments agree to respect the rules. And to make those rules work in practice, you need laws, courts and an elite group of technicians who know how to work the levers: in other words, lawyers.\\nTraditionally, the British left was sceptical of the postwar human rights project, seeing it as a distraction from class struggle – and a tool the right could use to prevent any socialist government from redistributing wealth, on the grounds of individual liberty. When Starmer was starting out as a lawyer, co-founding the progressive Doughty Street barristers' chambers in 1990, he expressed a similar scepticism. In a 1991 article for the radical Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers – of which he was a prominent member – Starmer warned that relying on legal institutions to bring about social change was “putting the cart before the horse”.\\nThe collapse of communism abroad and Thatcher's victory over organised labour at home prompted a change in attitudes. After the 1992 election, the Labour party committed to introducing a bill that would incorporate human rights protections into UK law. Writing in 1995, Starmer welcomed the prospect. “Our task, as socialist lawyers,” he argued, was to begin drafting a document that would bring about “an equal … distribution not only of political power, but also of economic power.” The following year, Starmer co-authored an audit of the UK's compliance with international human rights standards, an influential book in Labour circles as Blair's team drew up their plans for government.\\nBy the time of the 1997 election, Starmer was a rising legal star. His rightwing biographer Michael Ashcroft places him at the centre of the elite professional milieu that rose along with New Labour. Many progressive lawyers welcomed the arrival of the Human Rights Act, passed in 1998, amid the modernising first flush of Blairism. Phillippa Kaufmann, a leading human rights barrister and an ex-partner of Starmer's, told Starmer's favoured biographer, Tom Baldwin, that it felt as if they were “driving forward the vehicle of change”. Starmer, who in 2002 was made queen's counsel, or QC – the highest rank of barrister, now KC – added the act to his already formidable arsenal of expertise. In 2003, he represented a group of asylum-seekers who successfully challenged the government's attempt to deny them housing and benefit payments; a few years later, he helped overturn control orders (restrictions on the movement and liberty of terrorism suspects, introduced by Blair) that had been placed on two men. Both sets of cases were won on human rights grounds.\\nIt's not possible to read a barrister's list of cases as an index of their political opinions, since barristers – whose job is to argue in court on behalf of their clients – operate by the “cab rank” rule, where they must offer their services on a first come, first served basis. But by the areas of law in which they choose to specialise, it is possible to see where their interests lie. Starmer's interest clearly lay in protecting individuals from being harmed by the state and other powerful institutions. (One of his longest-running cases, for which he provided free legal advice, was that of the McLibel duo, environmentalist campaigners sued by McDonald's.) What that meant politically changed over time, however.\\nIn the early 00s, Starmer chose to advise the Northern Ireland Policing Board on how to make the Police Service of Northern Ireland, established after the Good Friday agreement, compliant with human rights standards. That work seemed to represent a shift in his view of the state. Rather than seeing it as an adversary that serves mainly to protect wealth and privilege, as a radical leftist might put it, according to Baldwin he was coming to believe that a human rights lawyer could work most effectively on the inside. By making the state's coercive functions compliant with human rights standards, they could be exercised more efficiently, and thus fairly.\\nAs DPP from 2008 to 2013, Starmer brought a fundamentally bureaucratic approach to the role, say his biographers. One of his proudest achievements, he has said, was overseeing his agency's transition from paper to digital record-keeping. Even Starmer's critics acknowledge that making top-down tweaks to the rules had some benefits. The criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, for instance, told me that Starmer's guidance to prosecutors advising a light touch on assisted dying cases averted a lot of unnecessary suffering. “I had several clients at police stations who weren't charged as a result,” he said.\\nAt other times, notably during the 2011 riots, Starmer was comfortable using the full force of the state – a fact that his leftwing biographer, Oliver Eagleton, takes him to task for. Whether Starmer was right or wrong to do so is another matter. But it's consistent with a particular interpretation of what human rights are there for. “I don't think there's a hidden emancipatory human rights fanatic inside Keir Starmer,” Gearty told me. Starmer decided to work within the state “because he understood the importance of the rules”.\\nA second tension within the human rights system is that it requires the cooperation of national governments, yet asks them to sign up to agreements that restrain their power. In the UK, that tension expresses itself most strongly in the political battle over the European convention on human rights and, by extension, the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into UK law. Together, they are intended to restrain the government and other public bodies from arbitrarily mistreating us.\\nA vocal section of the British right has long sought to weaken or remove these protections. But in the last few years it has become a totemic issue akin to Britain's membership of the EU before Brexit: withdrawing from the ECHR would, they say, take back control from a set of rules – and the liberal elite that upholds them – that are undermining national sovereignty. In particular, the right's opprobrium is directed at article 8, the right to a private and family life, which it claims forces the British state to let unwanted migrants live in the UK.\\nGiven Starmer's background, you would expect his government to be solidly opposed to this assault on human rights – and in a way, it has been. Among the first things Starmer did as prime minister was to state publicly that his government would never withdraw from the ECHR, one of several gestures intended to signal the incoming government's commitment to international treaties and the rule of law.\\nHuman rights NGOs agree that the shift in approach has changed things, up to a point. “There's a marked difference in the way I engage with this government compared with the last one,” says Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, who regularly meets with ministers and officials to discuss international and domestic policy. “They're willing to sit down and have thoughtful conversations about human rights issues.” The trouble, says Ahmed, is that this generally only extends to subjects the government sees as politically safe, such as the humanitarian crisis prompted by the war in Sudan. When her organisation raises more politically risky topics, such as migration or the Gaza war, then the government's response, especially at higher levels, is much more limited.\\nIn March, under pressure from the right, Starmer's government announced a review of how article 8 is used in immigration cases. Several human rights experts told me they believed this lent weight to a damaging myth that would, in the words of one campaigner at a human rights NGO, “pour fuel on the fire”. Jamie Burton, a senior barrister and a former colleague of Starmer's at Doughty Street, told me that ceding ground on article 8 – which also protects British citizens, for example, from unwanted media intrusion – would be a “lose-lose scenario”. In a recent article, Burton argued that the use of article 8 has already been so heavily restricted in immigration cases that any further tweaks would be useless and only encourage demands for the UK to drop it entirely. Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general, told me that in his view, attention would be better focused on delays in the courts system rather than article 8 itself. The delays, he said, were “not helpful to maintaining public confidence in the ECHR”.\\nGrieve, who as attorney general oversaw Starmer as DPP, told me he was confident in the prime minister's commitment to human rights. For many lawyers, however – regardless of their personal views on policy – it is Starmer's own rhetoric that has been most upsetting. Notably, at a session of prime minister's questions in February 2025, Starmer said that a court had made the “wrong decision” to allow a family of six trying to flee Gaza to join their brother in the UK, based on a “legal loophole”. Whether the decision was based on any kind of loophole is questionable: a judge found that while they had applied under the Ukraine resettlement scheme, for which they were ineligible, they nonetheless had the right to reunite with their brother under article 8. But many lawyers were appalled that Starmer, of all people, would criticise the decision of an independent court. “For him to criticise a judge as prime minister with his background was extraordinary,” another KC who worked with Starmer in the 00s told me. (At the time, in response to the criticism – including from Lady Carr, the most senior judge in England and Wales – a spokesperson for Starmer said he had full respect for the independence of the judiciary.)\\nStarmer's rhetoric can be explained as the government's response to the rise of Reform UK. “They're expecting a further Tory wipeout, so the next election will be Starmer v Farage,” one person familiar with cabinet-level discussions told me. “That's the explicit strategy. But what's not explicit is what that means for the postwar settlement and human rights, all these knock-on effects.” The source continued: “If you're more on the left of that debate, if you're David Lammy or Angela Rayner or Lisa Nandy, you don't want to stick your hand up in cabinet and say, have we thought about where this is heading – because you'll get a combination of Morgan McSweeney, John Healey and Pat McFadden [respectively, Starmer's chief of staff and two cabinet ministers] saying, ‘What the fuck are you talking about?'” Both the source and another person familiar with cabinet-level discussions said that ministers whose views differ also fear being anonymously briefed against in the media.\\nThe real problem, both added, is that you never know where Starmer himself sits. As if to illustrate the point, in May the current attorney general, Richard Hermer – appointed by Starmer last July – gave a major speech on the government's commitment to the rule of law. For the most part, it was a strongly worded critique of the “pseudo-realists” in Westminster who argue that the old global order is dead and that Britain should withdraw from the ECHR and other treaties it finds inconvenient. It was a notable intervention, since Hermer, another former human rights barrister, has become a lightning rod for the right's critique of the Starmer government.\\nIn an echo of the attacks once deployed against Starmer when he was leader of the opposition, Hermer's critics have been dredging up his old cases to cast aspersions on his politics. (The most lurid stunt so far involves a video in which the Conservative shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, parades in front of easels showing pictures of Hermer's former clients, including Shamima Begum and Gerry Adams.) Hermer has been briefed against from within Labour, too, by officials who believe his professional background and insistence that ministers follow legal advice closely are damaging the party's image. But Starmer has, for now, kept his attorney general in post. “Starmer has put Hermer there to keep himself honest,” suggested one Labour strategist I spoke to.\\nIn that context, it was tempting to see Hermer's speech as a sign of Starmer's own worldview. Within hours, however, Hermer found himself at the centre of yet more criticism, for suggesting the “pseudo-realists” were borrowing their ideas from the 20th-century German jurist Carl Schmitt. In scholarly circles, Schmitt's conservative ideas are widely discussed – but he's better known for being the Nazis' favourite legal theorist. A day later, Downing Street ordered Hermer to apologise.\\nFor some people I spoke to, this showed one of Starmer's wider weaknesses: he is committed to following the letter of the law, but unwilling to take the risk of arguing for the underlying principles. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, human rights have almost become dirty words,” said Karla McLaren, political relations manager for Amnesty International's UK branch. “We were hoping the new government would come in and try to change that. But that's not what we've seen. If you look at what cabinet ministers say, even when they're talking about human rights issues, they very rarely use human rights language.”\\nOne person familiar with cabinet-level conversations made a similar point, in reference to the ECHR. “We've allowed the right to define the issue. It does seem baffling to me that we keep attacking a bunch of laws that are very much in our interest, and probably more in our interest than for some other countries.”\\nA third tension in the human rights system is that it requires powerful states to enforce it, yet is undermined by an unequal global distribution of power. If states can pick and choose who is held accountable for human rights abuses, then it makes a mockery of the claim these rights are universal – and gives other states less of an incentive to participate. Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the west's response to the war in Gaza, an issue that, as one official put it to me, “people have lots of very strong views about”.\\nTo date, in its response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel has killed at least 59,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch – NGOs whose reports are regularly cited by lawyers in Starmer's former specialism – are among those who say Israel is committing genocide. (Both also say that Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, including hostage-taking and the murder of civilians.) Yet Israel has been able to pursue its military action relatively unhindered thanks to support from its allies: the UK, certainly, but most of all the US, its principal military, financial and political backer.\\nAs the dominant global power since 1945, the US played a significant role in shaping the human rights system (Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady, was a driving force behind the Universal Declaration) but its commitment to that system has been patchy. “You didn't have to be super radical to think that the international legal order was designed for the west,” Gearty told me, but in years gone by “you could slightly pretend it wasn't”. The west's support of Israel's war, he believes, has made the imbalance impossible to ignore.\\nSince taking office, Labour has tried to tread a fine line on Israel, between being seen to abide by international law, and continuing to support an ally it says has the right to defend itself from Hamas and hostile states such as Iran. At the same time, it has been keen not to upset the US, particularly since Trump took office. According to the two people familiar with cabinet-level discussions, there are disagreements in government about how best to approach this, analogous to the divisions over how to deal with Reform UK – a “dog-eat-dog” worldview, as one put it, versus a more humanitarian-minded one. Both positions are generally supportive of Israel, said the other source, but differ on people's “relative strength of support for Netanyahu”.\\nAs ever, it's not clear exactly where the prime minister sits. But as Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire report in their recent book on Labour's return to power, Starmer has exerted tight control over Labour's position on Israel since 7 October, in contrast to issues where he has been happy to delegate. His behaviour, they write, has been driven by several motivations: horror at the Hamas attacks; a desire, at least in the early days, to show that Labour had moved on from the Corbyn years by signalling strong support for Israel; and a belief that any significant departure from the US position would be futile.\\nIn opposition, this involved saying as little as possible except that Israel had a right to defend itself and that international law should be respected. In government, Labour has criticised aspects of Israel's military campaign and has affirmed the UK's support for the international criminal court's jurisdiction. (It has said that the UK would fulfil its “legal obligations” if the Israeli prime minister, for whom the ICC has issued an arrest warrant, visits the UK – implying, but not directly confirming, that it would carry out an arrest.) On the occasions it has broken with US policy – for instance, when the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway recently placed individual sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers – it has tried to do so only in concert with other states.\\nThis is accompanied by a studied (some might say lawyerly) refusal to say in public whether or not the Israeli government as a whole is breaking international law. Doing so would have big implications, since Britain may then be obliged to follow its own human rights laws and impose wider-reaching sanctions, potentially suspending its substantial trade, military cooperation and intelligence-sharing agreements with Israel. Officials may have to reveal what they knew when; among other things, it is a criminal offence for public servants to knowingly assist in war crimes overseas.\\nIt has led to some erratic gestures. Most prominently, in March, Downing Street forced the foreign secretary, David Lammy, to walk back comments that by blocking aid from reaching Gaza – an act now causing mass starvation – Israel had definitely broken international law. (The official line was that Israel was only “at risk” of doing so.) In public, ministers have said, once again, that it is for the courts to determine whether Israel is committing genocide. But Starmer has also invoked his own legal credentials to deflect criticism. “I'm well aware of the definition of genocide,” he snapped in a testy exchange at prime minister's questions last November, “and that is why I've never described this as […] genocide”. (The international court of justice, which is considering an accusation of genocide made against Israel by South Africa, is not expected to deliver a ruling until 2027.)\\nThe most delicate footwork, however, relates to weapons sales. On taking office last year, Labour announced a review of UK arms exports to Israel. Britain is one of the world's largest arms producers, with export orders worth about £10bn a year, and in theory a system exists to stop them being used for human rights abuses. Manufacturers can only export weapons if the government gives them a licence to do so – although, according to a recent whistleblower, the system is too easy to manipulate.\\nAt the end of August 2024, according to documents recently disclosed to the high court, Starmer personally phoned Netanyahu to warn him that the UK would be suspending 30 of 350 arms export licences. Civil servants had assessed there was a risk Israel would use these weapons to violate international law, but there was an exception. Essential parts produced by British companies for F-35 planes – the world's deadliest fighter jets, designed and made mostly in the US – would continue to be shared among the UK's allies, including Israel, since they were necessary for “global peace and security”.\\nThis summer, a long-running legal challenge to that decision came to a head in the high court. Lawyers for the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq argued it contravened the genocide convention, the Geneva conventions, the UN arms trade treaty and the UK's own export licensing rules. In its defence, part of the evidence for which was presented in secret, the government argued that continuing to supply the parts – which contribute to a joint programme between the UK, the US and several other Nato members, as well as favoured partners such as Israel and Saudi Arabia – was necessary to maintain a deterrent against Russia. Moreover, said the government, it was impossible for the UK to determine where the parts are distributed, since the US arms company Lockheed Martin controls many of the warehouses in which they are stored. As with so many other things, it was ultimately the US calling the shots – or, as the government's lawyers put it in more opaque language, “the US is primarily responsible for contracting with contractors”.\\nOn 30 June, the high court ruled in the government's favour, saying that decisions about security were a matter for the executive, not the courts. For some people I spoke to, this is just the unpleasant reality of politics. “National security interests sometimes mean that you have to do things or tolerate things that you might not otherwise be very happy about,” Grieve told me. Others are less forgiving. Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, which intervened in the case in support of Al-Haq, told me that the government's position that it can opt out of the rules risks undermining the effectiveness of key human rights treaties.\\nEven more alarming, Ahmed said, was the government's reasoning over why it was not bound to act by the genocide convention, which says states have a duty to prevent genocide if there is a serious risk of it occurring. Government lawyers argued that a state could only be said to have breached that duty if it could be definitively proven that an act of genocide had taken place – “a very difficult exercise, which could take many years”, said the government – in other words, only after the event, when it would be too late to stop it. “That's just a shocking position to take,” Ahmed told me. “It's morally repugnant but also legally and factually wrong.”\\nEven supportive observers are critical of the decision to keep supplying F-35 parts, seeing it as emblematic of a wider lack of action to defend human rights in Gaza. “What happened on 7 October [2023] was a terrible crime, but there is no justification for what is going on today in Gaza, none whatsoever,” Philippe Sands told me. “The fact that it wasn't stopped long ago and that the British government has not gone further makes me extremely unhappy. Even if Britain is a friend of Israel, the role of friends is to speak truth to power.”\\nSands's fellow human rights expert Conor Gearty sympathises with the pressures Labour are under, but is critical nonetheless. “Starmer, Hermer, Lammy – they're all lawyers. [Lammy is also a qualified barrister and practised law before entering politics.] They're committed to law, but they can't bear the full consequences of committing to law.” A former senior diplomat who worked in Washington DC during the past decade told me that while the pressure from Trump was real, blaming the US was also an excuse British politicians often used when they wanted to avoid owning their decisions. “It's quite convenient, saying, ‘Oh don't do that, the Americans won't like it,'” said the former diplomat.\\nThis approach has also upset many civil servants representing the UK overseas. Earlier this year, more than 300 Foreign Office staff sent an open letter to Lammy raising fears they had become complicit in war crimes committed by Israel; in response, the department's chief civil servant told them to consider resigning. “It's quite humiliating for a lot of people,” says a former civil servant who recently worked at the Foreign Office. “People working on Russia and Ukraine are saying, how can we be demanding accountability for human rights abuses here when we're ignoring them in Gaza? We look like hypocrites.”\\nThe former civil servant said that when Labour took power, they were “hopeful that Labour would realise the value of the rule of law and work to uphold it. This didn't last. If anything, Lammy's response to the letter was more ‘corporate computer says no' than David Cameron [his Conservative predecessor as foreign secretary]. Cameron would at least read the letter and think about a response rather than ‘HR' it.”\\nWe've been here before. New Labour took office in 1997 promising great things on human rights – incorporating the ECHR into law at home and promising an “ethical foreign policy” abroad. It did the legal, procedural part, introducing the Human Rights Act and lending British support to global initiatives such as the international criminal court. But it backed away from the wider project. As the Human Rights Act came into force, it was attacked by the rightwing press. Under pressure – as the human rights expert Francesca Klug writes in her 2015 book on the subject – the Blair government abandoned a public awareness campaign extolling the benefits of the act. It also dropped plans to extend its reach to the economic sphere, which would have made issues such as a decent standard of living a matter of human rights, too, as the Universal Declaration originally envisioned. Meanwhile, Blair's enthusiastic participation in the “war on terror” helped undermine the UN and led him to restrict civil liberties at home.\\nCarne Ross, a senior diplomat under the Blair government who resigned in protest at the Iraq war, told me that the travails of the Starmer government remind him of this period. “There's a sense that human rights is a luxury parties give themselves in opposition, but in government national security takes over,” said Ross. “It's a false choice, though, because prioritising human rights is a greater contribution to long-term stability and ultimately security.”\\nHuman rights advocates have plenty of specific policy demands. But is there more the UK could do to defend the system as a whole? For Gearty, Labour's contortions reflect “the weakness that is at the core of Britain's standing in the world, which voters can never be told about, because British voters continue to believe that this country is a world power”. The trouble, according to Gearty, is that these contortions only make the problem worse. “Britain has little credibility for three reasons,” he said. “One, it is seen as the child of America, with no independent engagement. Two, Britain is an imperial nation that has not yet addressed what imperialism meant; it still largely believes that it granted independence to grateful global south entities. And three, having left Europe, it has no strategic vision of anything.”\\nSands is slightly more optimistic. “We live in a world of double standards. So what's new? My entire life with international law, we've lived with these kinds of situations,” he says. Sands believes the threat to the postwar human rights system is real, because the world's three greatest powers – the US, Russia and China – are now all actively hostile to the project. “But in that context,” he says, “the Starmer government is going against the grain. I think it's courageous.” In particular, Sands adds, countries in the global south that do not want to be bullied by their larger neighbours are still strongly invested in the human rights system – and the UK has the power to support their struggle.\\nFor the barrister Jamie Burton, the dual meaning of equality – economic as well as political – is key. “It's a real mistake to think about human rights as just being about technical rules, the courts and litigation,” he says. “They're a description of what society is supposed to look like.” For Burton, a renewed focus on economic equality would help take the sting out of the right's claims that human rights are for “other” people only and disadvantage ordinary British citizens. At one point, at least, Starmer was known to be sympathetic to this argument. In opposition, according to Pogrund and Maguire, he would frequently brandish a copy of the Marmot review, a landmark decade-long study on health and inequality in Britain, as an example of where Labour's attention should lie. Now? It's less clear.\\nWhen writing this piece, one story I heard kept coming back to mind. Earlier this year, a delegation of British Palestinians met with Starmer to ask for more aid to reach Gaza and for refugees to be allowed to join their relatives in the UK. As one of the Palestinians there described it to me, Starmer listened patiently and sensitively to their concerns, but did not propose anything new. Towards the end of the meeting, a teenage member of the group spoke up. “She said, ‘My ambition in life is to be a human rights lawyer like you. And I was very disappointed to hear what you just said. We were expecting more.'”\\nThe Palestinian campaigner continued: “I thought, that's very brave of her,” he told me, adding that he was worried, at first, that she had offended their host. But he was surprised by the prime minister's reaction – or lack of it. “He looked a bit shocked, but he didn't say anything.” \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\"]"

         "[\"The Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility in May where immigrants rounded up as part of the Trump administration's campaign of mass deportation were being housed. She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical care.\\nTwo months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied entry.\\nIt wasn't an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held.\\nDemocratic officials' legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president's supercharged immigration agenda.\\n“The administration's goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they're doing in the dark to others who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.”\\nMcIver, who has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding.\\nRepublicans accuse Democrats of failing to follow protocol, and say their unannounced visits are more political grandstanding than genuine congressional oversight. But Democrats counter that it is their responsibility to shed light on the most hidden aspects of Trump's deportation agenda, which has ensnared Daca recipients, legal residents and even US citizens.\\nA report released last week by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff's office, compiled in part from site visits, found widespread human rights abuses in immigrant detention centers, including the mistreatment of pregnant women and children. “Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,” the report noted. The DHS sought to debunk the report, calling its allegations “garbage” and saying Ossoff and his staff have never been denied oversight visits.\\nLast month, a dozen Democratic members of Congress filed suit over a Trump-era DHS policy requiring members of Congress and their staff to provide a week's notice before any requested visit. They say the requirement is more than red tape – it is unconstitutional. The rule, the lawmakers argue in their suit, unlawfully restricts their oversight authority and prevents a co-equal branch of government from doing its job.\\nUnder a provision of federal law that funds Ice, the government may not prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens”. Requiring advance notice, Democrats say, gives the administration time to create a misleading picture of daily operations.\\n“This is kind of like general oversight 101,” Colorado representative Jason Crow, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs, told the Guardian. “You announce a visit, and they roll out what they want you to see, and things are dressed up and cleaned up.”\\nCrow has conducted site inspections at immigration detention sites in his district since 2019 – and he helped pass the law that solidified Congress's right to make unannounced inspections. In July, he was blocked from entering a center in Aurora.\\nSimilar confrontations are playing out nationwide. On Wednesday, a delegation of Democratic representatives from New York, including the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Adriano Espaillat, were turned away from a center in Brooklyn now housing detained immigrants under a new agreement with the Bureau of Prisons.\\n“This blatant lack of respect towards the legislative branch is a deterioration of checks and balances,” Espaillat said after the encounter. “All while they hide their atrocities from the public.”\\nIn a response posted on X, the DHS called the lawmakers' efforts “deeply unserious”. “These members did not follow proper protocol and schedule their visit. Instead they brought a gaggle of media to drive clicks and fundraising emails,” the department said.\\nIn a statement, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Ice had imposed the new visitation policy to protect the president's constitutional authority to carry out immigration enforcement and protect agency personnel from “a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement – including by member of Congress themselves”.\\n“A week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President's constitutional authority,” she said.\\nAs relatives and lawyers struggle to locate and contact people in Ice custody, advocates say congressional visits are essential to building a public record of conditions inside facilities that operate far from public view.\\n“We are not talking about a mistake here and there,” said Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS. “We're talking about a pattern of abuse that is happening in multiple communities, and bearing witness to that, and building that record so that members who may want to … are not able to say that this is happenstance or anecdotal.”\\nIce arrests and detentions rose sharply in the first six months after Trump returned to the White House. In Democratic-leaning states masked Ice agents are frequently arresting immigrants at worksites, in the streets and in mass roundups – aggressive tactics that triggered protests in cities such as Los Angeles. Their targets are increasingly people with no criminal records at all.\\nAs arrests soar to record numbers, the nation's immigration detention system – a patchwork of government-run and private facilities – is buckling under the strain. By late June, it was over capacity by more than 13,500 people, according to a Guardian analysis of public data from the Deportation Data Project. Ten immigration detainees have died in federal custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024.\\nMcLaughlin called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers “categorically false”. The agency, she added, has “worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space” to accommodate the Trump administration's mass arrest and incarceration operation.\\nThe scramble to create more detention beds has seen the agency sign new contracts with private prisons companies, as well as federal and state prisons. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, recently touted plans to open a detention center in Indiana it calls the “Speedway Slammer”, following the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz”, a facility built in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Last week, the Pentagon said Fort Bliss, an army base in Texas, was prepared to accept as many as 1,000 immigrant detainees by the end of the month.\\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration was ordered to improve conditions inside an immigration holding facility in New York City, after advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of detainees who described being kept in unsanitary and overcrowded cells, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products.\\n***\\nShortly after immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, triggering days of tense protests, Congresswoman Judy Chu of California said her office began receiving urgent requests from advocates and worried family members asking for help locating people believed to be held at a center in the remote desert town of Adelanto.\\nChu had visited the facility several times during her years in office. But on 8 June, guards scrambled to lock the fence when she arrived with California congressmen Gil Cisneros and Derek Tran, she recounted. The trio shouted their names and held up signs identifying themselves as members of Congress – but they were turned away.\\n“It was illegal, of course, because we have this right to go in,” Chu said in an interview.\\nMore than a week later, Chu and a larger delegation of California Democrats were granted access to the facility and were able to meet with people detained during the raids, including a Daca recipient. Some said they had gone days without a change of clothes and were, in many cases, unable to call their families or legal representatives.\\n “We must keep on trying, because otherwise we don't know what will happen to these detainees,” Chu said, vowing to push for more access. “The less attention that is being given through our oversight inspections, the more [DHS] thinks it can get away with the worst conditions possible.”\\nCongressman Jay Obernolte, a Republican of California, came away with a different impression when he toured the Adelanto facility in July, days after Trump deployed the national guard and active duty marines to quell the immigration protests that had erupted across Los Angeles. In a statement, he said that those in custody at the facility have “access to medical care, legal counsel, meals, and the full rights guaranteed under federal law”.\\n“Facilities like Adelanto exist to help Ice enforce our immigration laws and keep our communities safe,” he said. “The vast majority of detainees housed here have committed serious crimes in addition to being present in our country illegally. They are being processed quickly, fairly, and humanely.”\\nIn a statement,\\u200b a spokesman\\u200b for the private prison firm GEO Group said that\\u200b the detention facilities it operates, like Adelanto in California and elsewhere across the country, provide “around-the-clock access to medical care\\u200b” as well as “in-person and virtual\\u200b legal and family visitation” in addition to other services. \\u200bThe detention centers adhered to strict federal detention standards on safety, food and medical care in addition to the facility's capacity, the spokesman said, stating: “Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.\\u200b”\\nAs Democratic officials continue to face barriers, they have started sharing best practices for securing access.\\nBefore visiting a facility in Eloy, Arizona, to check on a local restaurant owner held there in Ice custody, Congressman Greg Stanton consulted another member of Congress for advice. He brought a copy of the law that affirms members' oversight rights and asked to speak with senior officials on site.\\nStill, he was refused entry.\\n“I think others feel the same way I do, which is, you don't get to pick and choose which laws you follow,” Stanton said. “And it may be inconvenient to have a member of Congress show up and try to do their duty of oversight, but that doesn't matter. This is what the law says, and you've got to follow the law.”\\nBrian Todd, a spokesman for the private prison contractor CoreCivic, which operates the Eloy Detention Center, said that while the company endeavors to be “as accommodating and transparent as possible,” all congressional visits must be coordinated through Ice's office of congressional relations. He also said that the facilities were closely monitored by federal observers to ensure compliance and said claims of poor food or water quality at the center were “patently false”.\\n“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people,” Todd said, “but the fact is we operate safe, secure facilities that provide high quality services for our government partners at Ice”.\\nCrow, the Colorado congressman, began inspections of a privately operated immigration facility outside Denver in 2019, following repeated community reports about poor conditions, disease outbreaks, access to medical care and poor food storage.\\n“I represent a lot of immigrants and refugees, and frequently we're dealing with their families or with constituents and checking on individual conditions or access to counsel for residents of our district,” he said.\\nAt first, access was limited – prompting his push to strengthen protections for members of Congress. He eventually created a toolkit complete with a template for oversight visits, which he now shares with other members of Congress.\\n“There are egregious abuses occurring on a daily basis around the country, everything from unmarked vans with masked agents jumping out and grabbing people … to the lack of access to legal counsel and a variety of abuses,” he said. “So that's what we're worried about. And clearly this administration wants to hide their activities.”\\nMcIver, whose charges stem from an attempt to shield Newark mayor Ras Baraka from arrest during a protest at the facility, said she still has a right to conduct oversight visits – she remains a member of Congress and serves on a homeland security committee. But with a serious legal case pending, she has opted not to return – for now.\\n“They're using me as an example to try to be as cruel as possible to me and humiliate me and intimidate me, hoping that that will carry over to other people,” she said.\\nDespite the risks, other Democratic members of Congress are still showing up – even when doors are slammed in their faces – because, as McIver put it, “it's their job”.\\n“They're not stopping.”\", \"It starts with a quiz from a law firm: did your grandparents leave before or after 1951? Do you have their passports or marriage certificate?\\nIf I answer correctly, I will get another email from a lawyer who specializes in citizenship claims. If I do not, my file may be quietly marked as a long shot. The stakes are high: if successful, I could ultimately obtain an EU citizenship for myself and then perhaps for other members of my family.\\nLike many other Americans, I began this process in a moment of disillusionment. Since the 2024 election, I have been living with what I have come to call “citizenship insecurity”, a new category of instability that millions of us are now grappling with. It is the unsettling sense that a US passport, once a symbol of safety and mobility, is no longer something we identify with.\\nI am not living in fear of Ice raids; I am privileged enough to be a US citizen. I am not applying for another passport out of immediate danger or fear. Instead, it is about estrangement: I no longer recognize my country's values.\\nSince the US's inception, Americans have told ourselves a story about who we are and what we represent. We knew we were not perfect, but we thought America at least pretended to try to stand up for democracy and human rights. Much of that story has been tossed aside in the last decade, along with the dismantlement of our social contracts. “Citizenship insecurity” captures the depth of that unraveling, not necessarily imminent danger but no longer recognizing America, or trusting its values.\\n“My anxiety is through the roof right now, but I think it would be worse if I were not a citizen,” says Juan M Hincapie-Castillo, a researcher at the University of North Carolina and a recently naturalized American who first came to this country as an international student.\\nHe is experiencing citizenship insecurity to the max. “I am still brown, queer, and have an accent. I have tattoos that I cover every time I travel and go through TSA,” he says. “I keep hearing stories of legal residents and citizens being detained.”\\nThe instability Hincapie-Castillo experiences is a more targeted and virulent form than what I am experiencing. Right now, just being queer or brown – or even simply having tattoos, given the outsized role those have played in the recent roundups of alleged immigrant gang members – can seem to make a person more vulnerable to being singled out.\\nJust this month, Hincapie-Castillo's medical research on pain management treatments was defunded by the Trump administration. He studies trigeminal neuralgia, a facial nerve condition that is so cruel it is sometimes referred to as a “suicide disease”.\\nHis work had been funded for five years by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), but the grant was terminated after only one year. The stated reason for termination: a new NIH policy declaring that research programs connected to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are “antithetical to scientific inquiry”. (Some demographics' pain no longer counts to those in power, apparently.)\\nIndeed, this is another part of citizenship insecurity today: the economic pressures on scholars as federal funding has been haphazardly cut in the sciences and other disciplines. A number of these academics are internationally born, which adds an additional layer of uncertainty.\\n“The fear is always there,” he says of his current life. “I carry my US passport now everywhere I go, just in case.”\\nOf course, the woes of American citizens experiencing insecurity like Hincapie-Castillo do not even compare to the threat against non-citizens: it is as if many of us are nesting dolls of uncertainty.\\nBy 1 June, 51,302 people were in Ice detention. As of 13 July , the number had ticked up to 56,816. The Ice site has not shared numbers for deportations in 2025 publicly yet. The current head of Ice apparently told an Arizona Mirror reporter that our deportation system needs to be more like “Amazon Prime, but with human beings”. He meant that as a good thing.\\nAnd yet, the fear American citizens who are in far less outright peril also feel is still real. Recently, Donald Trump threatened to withdraw the actor Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship. Petulant as his threat was, it nonetheless showed that the president would like to denaturalize even native-born people who he reviles. The threat to birthright citizenship speaks to that same issue.\\n***\\nCitizenship insecurity is about grappling with what it means to be American when so many of our supposed ideals have vanished – not just from policy, but from political discourse itself.\\nThis is not the first time Americans have lived alongside wars or policies they did not support. For decades, many of us have witnessed enormous political endeavors we did not approve of, from the war in Iraq to the war in Vietnam. This included the “forever wars”, which were attacks on much we valued about our country, all at once, but it also included phenomena that presage and accompany those wars: torture, military occupation and Islamophobia at home.\\nAs a journalist focused on income inequality and economic insecurity, I did not buy into the “American dream” mythos. Editing big stories about economic inequality in this country day in, day out, I have been shown over and over that the notion of pulling yourself by your bootstraps is a fantasy. I have interviewed people who did everything “right” – saving money, pursuing higher education, working 40 hours a week – and still live from paycheck to paycheck, unable to buy a home or to even recognize a clear life trajectory.\\nNonetheless, a small part of myself held on to an idea of America as a beacon of sorts, as it had been for my immigrant grandparents.\\nMy grandfather left a town that has been controlled by different countries in eastern Europe for the US in 1929, returned to marry my grandmother, and together they came back again in the early 1930s. But most of our family did not make it out. They died there: Jews caught in a hideous historical fulcrum, crushed by the machinery of genocide and occupation.\\nAs a result, my grandparents loathed talking about the past and what happened there, preferring to pass it over in silence. What would they think of the choice that I and others were hoping to make now?\\nAmerica had offered them a chance to own their own store and for their children to go to college; my mother even made it to the Ivy League on scholarship. It was not a country I ever wanted to have an opportunity to leave or thought I or my family might need one.\\nThat has changed – for me and others.\\nNadia Kaneva, for example, is a media and communications professor at the University of Denver who has spent years studying how nations brand themselves. Born in Bulgaria and only recently naturalized as an American, Kaneva is feeling citizenship insecurity in real time.\\nAs a scholar, she has long understood how a country that is no longer desirable to emigrate to affects and is affected by foreign investment, tourism and brain drain. In the US, symbolic security has started to erode and other countries are jumping on the opportunities. A few European universities, for instance, have announced programs to recruit American researchers to Europe, especially if they are, say, public health scholars or environmental studies specialists or sociologists concentrating on gender.\\nKazim Ali, a co-founder of Nightboat Books and the author of the book Resident Alien, feels that the challenge to his and others' identities as Americans is “existential as well as direct”. He emigrated here with his parents, who were Muslims born in India (“So India doesn't feel like home, either, at the moment,” he says).\\nWould he ever consider leaving? To this, he quotes the Uruguayan poet Cristina Peri Rossi, who once said of her condition of exile and return: “I don't want to trade one nostalgia for another.”\\n***\\nIt is not only longtime citizens who are rethinking what it means to be American. Even those newly eligible for citizenship – people who once looked forward to formally pledging allegiance – are now pausing.\\nThose people “have told me they are now torn”, says Michele Wucker, a risk governance expert who also has written extensively about citizenship. “The actions of this administration do not align with the country they thought we were. And now they question the logic of becoming a citizen out of fear of how Maga believes we should treat non-citizens.”\\nOf course, some argue that seeking out the insurance of a second passport or planning to escape to a university job in another country is weak-hearted – that we must stay and fight for the democracy we want to live in. Others decry running away as unpatriotic, as when scholars of authoritarianism at Yale – Timothy Snyder, Jason Stanley and Marci Shore – announced publicly that they were moving to Canada for academic positions.\\nIn response, the scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan wrote that we should seek ballast from the writer James Baldwin's “unromantic patriotism” in these times and “stay, fight, and to urge others to as well.”\\nI see his and other writers' point: given my own relatively privileged position, I would never leave this country unless I really felt I had to.\\nI interviewed a Jewish faith leader who is originally from Israel, has an American passport but is also in the middle of obtaining her Portuguese citizenship (she is Sephardic, meaning her ancestors are from the Iberian peninsula). She wants to remain anonymous in part to protect her child, who is transgender, and expanding her options for citizenship feels more urgent than ever. She is also applying, she says, because the current American political situation plays “into centuries-old insecurity of the Jewish people”. For her, citizenship insecurity has been compounded by what she calls “the state of violence of the country [Israel] I come from”. The sense of instability is not confined to one place – it echoes across borders. It is not just about mobility or paperwork – it is about protection, about having somewhere for her child to go if things get worse.\\nMelissa Aronczyk, a media studies professor at Rutgers University and author of Branding the Nation: the Global Business of National Identity, comes from Canada. She has been thinking of returning home “incessantly” since January. “There is a cabal of Canadians in the US where that's a central topic right now,” she says. In conversations in a Facebook group for her fellow expats living in the US, trying to get their kids into Canadian universities has become a far more insistent theme as of late. “Canadian American parents getting their kids to apply to Canadian rather than American universities was once a tuition move,” says Aronczyk. Now, she says it's also political as well.\\nAronczyk, like many of the people I spoke to, is quick to acknowledge her relative privilege. We know we are lucky, even, in being able to consider second citizenships. But that is precisely the point: when even the relatively economically secure feel as if the ground shifts beneath them, it signals just how deep and wide this instability runs.\\nAs an expert on national branding, Aronczyk notes that the US's image has sharply deteriorated in the past six months. Since the start of Trump's second administration, global perceptions of America “have gone negative, by almost every measure”.\\nA national brand is defined as much by people with American passports as people watching our country from the outside: students, tourists and investors, she points out.\\n***\\nIn June, I started my regular correspondence with a law firm representing people seeking European citizenship. Each time I wrote and heard back from them, I recalled my beloved grandfather.\\nIn one old photo, he wore his cavalry uniform, adorned with sparking buttons. I remember that handsome expression from my childhood in the 1970s when he was already an old man, still attractive and bewildered. Whether that was due to his feeling caught in the gears of history or not it was hard to say.\\nWhat I do know was he was eager to be the sort of American who took his kids to movie palaces and had college money tucked away for their grandchildren, no matter that he and grandma worked six days a week in a shoe store to be able to do so. In his old age, he got to watch Star Trek with his feet up as the two ate strawberry ice-cream. Occasionally, once retired, my grandmother would even attend outdoor classical concerts and free Shakespeare plays with her friends. This, to them, was the American dream.\\nIt still strikes me as uncanny, to even be considering giving myself and my family the possibility to go elsewhere if the worst happens here. After all, this country was my grandparents' refuge. But I imagine they would understand, and even approve. They knew all too well the cost of having the wrong citizenship at the wrong time.\", \"A day after Donald Trump announced that he was firing Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, the White House proudly released a photo. It showed Trump, his cabinet and other officials giving a thumbs-up. Of the 24 people in the Oval Office, only one was Black.\\nFor those who have studied the US president's long and troubling history of racism, the two events were more than mere coincidence. They were indicative of a man who has recently brought white nationalist perspectives from the margins back to the mainstream.\\nTrump has vehemently denied that he is a racist, pointing to a modest increase in support among African American voters in last year's election, when his opponent was a Black woman. But critics suggest that his effort to oust Cook fits a pattern of purging diverse voices from the higher ranks of leadership.\\n“He chose to fire her out of all the governors because she's a Black woman,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the organisation Black Voters Matter. “His goal is to get control of the Federal Reserve and for that to no longer be an autonomous, independent body. But what he does recognise is that in America everything is about race. It is as lethal as a nuclear bomb.”\\nCook taught economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and was previously on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. She was a Marshall scholar who received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, a historically Black women's college in Atlanta.\\nCook dedicated much of her scholarship to examining how racial discrimination and targeted violence created barriers to economic advancement for African Americans. She also advised the Nigerian and Rwandan governments on banking reforms and economic development.\\nIn 2022 she was confirmed to the Fed's board of governors by the Senate in a party-line vote. Republicans argued that she was unqualified and found her research overly focused on race; Democrats brushed off such critiques as unfounded.\\nOn Monday, Trump said he fired Cook after the director of a housing regulatory agency, whom the president appointed, alleged that she committed mortgage fraud. She refused to resign and filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump has no power to remove her from office.\\nTrump's order aligned with his effort to expand his power across once independent parts of the federal government and broader economy and culture. It also marked another potential high-profile removal of a Black leader from the federal government amid Trump's broader crusade against diversity and inclusion policies.\\nBrown observed: “He knows that racism and sexism is a very effective tool to cast doubt and that's the pathway. Lisa Cook isn't even the chair of the board. So why would you pick her?\\n“He picked her because he is betting that, in an industry that is probably 90% or more white male, his odds of removing her are greater than the odds for removing others from the board. That in itself is rooted in the history and how insidious racism is built into the fabric of how we see people of colour in this country.”\\nOver the past seven months Trump has targeted other prominent Black leaders. He fired Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the second Black man to serve in the position. Brown had delivered speeches about racial discrimination and issued policies that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the military.\\nThe president dismissed Carla Hayden, the first Black person to serve as librarian of Congress, after a conservative advocacy organisation accused her of being a “radical”. He ousted Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman to sit on the National Labor Relations Board, which hears private-sector labour disputes.\\nTrump's critics argue that his life and career have given succour to white supremacists. In 1973 he and his father were sued for housing discrimination in New York; in 1989 he took out full-page ads in several newspapers calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, Black and Latino youths who were later exonerated.\\nTrump broke through in national politics with the “birther” conspiracy theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore ineligible to be president. After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides”.\\nHe has reportedly described Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries”, has called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”, and, on the campaign trail last year, said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.\\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has imposed a travel ban on many of the world's poorest countries even as the US granted refugee status to about 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”.\\nHe issued executive orders to curb DEI initiatives in the federal government and even sought to blame DEI for an air crash. He is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” from Smithsonian Institution museums, suggesting that there is too much focus on “how bad Slavery was”.\\nThe attempt to fire Cook is the most dubious move yet, prompting an outcry from Democrats and civil rights groups, who pointed to her gender and race as vital factors.\\nCongresswoman Nanette Barragán of California posted on the X social media platform: “If you haven't noticed yet – this is a disturbing pattern for Trump. Fire or drive out smart, competent women, in particular women of color, from high ranking positions and fill many of these positions with white men.”\\nDerrick Johnson, president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said: “Dr Cook's credentials outshine Trump's entire cabinet. This president simply cannot stomach Black excellence when it reveals his failures, particularly those in positions of power. In reality, this is about bending the Federal Reserve to Trump's will, and he's using racism as a tool to do it.”\\nBut Trump's actions are being cheered on by white nationalists. Far-right groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have been quoted as saying that they no longer need to take to the streets to demonstrate because the president has so comprehensively adopted their talking points and embraced their agenda.\\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, observed: “When you have white supremacists who are holding key roles in government and you have leaders in this country who come and play footsie to their drumbeat they don't have to resist because what they want is laid out for them in the form of a buffet.”\\nTrump has been quick to point to Black allies when politically expedient, such as Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, the representative Byron Donalds of Florida and Alveda King, a niece of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. But critics note there is no guarantee this will translate to policies that address racial injustice.\\nNor has it manifested in significant representation at the heart of government. Towards the end of the first Trump presidency, the Washington Post identified 59 people who had held cabinet positions or served in top White House jobs. Only seven were people of colour and only one – the housing secretary, Ben Carson – was Black.\\nIn his second term, Trump has picked only one Black person to serve in his cabinet: Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development. Joe Biden, by contrast, appointed the most diverse cabinet in history with more women and people of colour than any that had come before.\\nSeawright said: “We went from generational progress to generational rollback, and what this president and this administration has done in seven months could take 70 years at least to replenish. It should be a friendly reminder for all people, but particularly African Americans, that all progress is not permanent.”\\nTrump's cabinet includes Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host with no experience of running a major organisation, at the Pentagon; Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, at the health department; and Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, at the education department. The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has associated with white nationalist thinkers and groups and is the architect of his hardline immigration policy.\\nRashad Robinson, a civil rights leader and former president of the group Color of Change, added: “We live in a very diverse country, a country with many different types of people that come from many different backgrounds, and the president exhibits his values by who he puts in office.\\n“This is not simply that Donald Trump has put only one Black person in his cabinet. It's that Donald Trump has gone out of his way to find some of the most unqualified and ill-equipped people to put in those jobs as a way to actually avoid having to put Black people in his cabinet.”\\nFor Brown, the voting rights activist, Trump's cabinet picks demonstrate that he is “as racist as hell”. She added: “Quite frankly, I'm glad he doesn't have a whole lot of Black people in his cabinet because that would be deeply embarrassing to me. Who would work in that mess?”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"Brazil's supreme court has made Jair Bolsonaro the first former president in the country's history to be convicted for attempting a coup.\\nThe 70-year-old far-right leader claims he is the victim of political persecution, but four out of five judges concluded on Thursday that it was sufficiently proven that Bolsonaro and his close allies attempted to overturn the 2022 election, which he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nSeven other members of his administration were also convicted, including senior military officers – something also unprecedented in a country that endured a brutal two-decade military dictatorship (1964–85).\\nAfter months of investigation, the federal police and the attorney general concluded that a “criminal organisation” led by Bolsonaro carried out a long list of different ways to keep the former paratrooper in power at all costs.\\nThe plot included a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-president and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who in 2022 was presiding over the electoral court. After the election, Lula and Moraes were closely monitored by special forces soldiers.\\nAccording to investigators, the murderous plot was abandoned only because Bolsonaro managed to win over just one of the three armed forces chiefs, the navy commander, while the heads of the air force and the army refused to join.\\nThe climax of the power-grab attempt was the riot on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula took office, when hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the presidential palace, congress and supreme court in the capital, Brasília.\\nThe only judge to acquit Bolsonaro was Luiz Fux, who argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the former president's guilt. He also contended that the trial should be annulled, saying the supreme court was not the proper venue and endorsing a defence claim that, because the investigation generated about 70 terabytes of documents, Bolsonaro's lawyers had been unable to review all the case materials.\\nBolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months.\\nBolsonaro has been under house arrest since 4 August, accused of trying to intimidate the supreme court's judges through a campaign led by his son Eduardo Bolsonaro in the US that resulted in tariffs and sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.\\nThe former president still has the right to appeal, although the margin of his conviction makes it unlikely it will be overturned. Once the appeals are concluded, probably in October or November, the justices will decide where he will serve his sentence.\\nGiven his recurring health problems, linked to a stabbing during the 2018 campaign, Bolsonaro will probably remain under house arrest, in a hospital or in a special unit inside a barracks or police facility.\\nEven before this week's conviction, Bolsonaro was already barred from forthcoming elections due to two previous rulings by the electoral court, one for attacking the voting system and another for using the presidency for electoral purposes.\\nBrazil's largely conservative congress, however, may vote on an amnesty bill for him and hundreds of those convicted over the 8 January riot. Justices have already deemed the proposal unconstitutional, so if it passes, a judicial battle is expected.\\nMeanwhile, figures on the far right – including Bolsonaro's politician sons and his wife – are battling to decide who will be the candidate to take on the leftist president Lula, who has announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections.\\nTrump had previously criticised the case against Bolsonaro and used it as one of the justifications for his 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, but most Brazilian legal experts agree there was substantial evidence for conviction and that due process was observed.\\nAfter Thursday's verdict, the US president told reporters he was “very unhappy” with the conviction and that he'd always found Bolsonaro to be “outstanding”. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on X that Washington would “respond accordingly to this witch hunt”.\\nBrazil's foreign ministry called Rubio's comment a threat that “attacks Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence in the records”. The ministry said Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.\\nTrump had already revoked the visas of Moraes and other justices of Brazil's supreme court. Moraes was also targeted with Magnitsky sanctions, generally reserved for perpetrators of severe human rights violations.\", \"Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his allies, including four senior members of the military, have gone on trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup – the first time in Brazilian history such powerful figures have faced justice for seeking to topple the country's democracy.\\nBolsonaro, a paratrooper turned far-right populist who governed from 2019 until 2023, stands accused of masterminding a failed power grab after losing the 2022 election to the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nBolsonaro and his seven alleged co-conspirators, including three army generals and the former head of the navy, face decades in jail if found guilty of being the driving force behind the unsuccessful plot.\\nOn Tuesday morning, the supreme court began what is expected to be a two-week judgment of the group. Over the course of eight televised hearings held between 2 and 12 September, five supreme court judges will decide their fate.\\nThe judge presiding over the trial, Alexandre de Moraes, kicked off the hearing describing how an anti-democratic plot to impose “a veritable dictatorship” had been foiled thanks to the strength of Brazilian society and institutions. A failure to punish that crime “would mean encouraging new attempted coups d'etat,” Moraes told the court, adding: “History teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice do not lead to pacification.”\\nThe prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, told the court it was essential those behind the “frightening and shadowy” conspiracy be held to account.\\nBrazil has suffered more than a dozen attempted putsches and coups d'état since 1889, when it became a republic after its last emperor, Pedro II, was overthrown. The last successful power grab came in 1964, when US-backed generals deposed the then president, João Goulart, supposedly to thwart a communist threat and ushering in 21 years of brutal military rule.\\nBut the historian Danilo Araújo Marques said that never before had top military leaders or a former president been tried for attacking democracy. “This truly is unprecedented and historic,” said Marques, who is part of a research unit at the Federal University of Minas Gerais called Projeto República.\\n“Whenever there was an attempted coup, and the coup didn't succeed, there was always an amnesty – and now we're seeing precisely the opposite,” Marques added, hailing the trial as tribute to the maturity of Brazil's institutions and democracy, which was restored in 1985. “Our democracy is going through an acid test and it's possible it will come out of this strengthened.” \\nOn the eve of the trial, the US president, Donald Trump, has attempted to sabotage proceedings with what analysts called an unprecedented pressure campaign that has thrown US-Brazil relations into disarray.\\nClaiming Bolsonaro was the victim of a “witch-hunt”, Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned Alexandre de Moraes, the judge presiding over the case. Other supreme court justices and Lula officials have been stripped of their US visas. Bolsonaro's congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has moved to the US to lobby Trump officials to take up his father's fight.\\n“It's a political intervention with an economic cudgel,” Thomas Shannon, a former US ambassador to Brazil, said of Trump's tariffs campaign.\\nShannon believed Trump had a clear political objective: to scupper Bolsonaro's prosecution, resuscitate the Brazilian populist's flagging political career, and allow Bolsonaro – who is currently banned from seeking office – to challenge Lula in next year's presidential election.\\nBut the ex-ambassador, who was based in Brasília from 2010 to 2013, believed the US president was mistaken if he believed he could help Bolsonaro escape punishment and “storm back into power” – just as Trump did last year.\\n“It [shows] such a cartoon-like understanding of Brazil – and I think what the president is doing at the behest of the Bolsonaros is actually going to harm the Bolsonaros in a really significant way,” Shannon said, noting how polls showed support for the ex-president falling.\\nIn contrast, support for Lula appears to be increasing, with Brazil's president using Trump's offensive to position himself as a flag-waving patriot defending Brazilian interests from a foreign onslaught. Lula has started wearing a blue, Maga-style cap emblazoned with the words: “Brazil belongs to the Brazilians.”\\nAsked last week if he would be tuning into his rival's coup trial, Lula shrugged: “I've got better things to do.”\\nThose in the dock alongside Bolsonaro include some of the best-known figures in his administration: the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; the former security minister, Anderson Torres; the former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; and Bolsonaro's former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid.\\nThe accusations against them relate to an alleged conspiracy to launch a pro-Bolsonaro coup in the months between the October 2022 election and the far-right uprising in Brasília on 8 January 2023 – a week after Lula took power.\\nBolsonaro denies plotting a coup but has admitted seeking “alternative” ways to stop Lula taking office. All of the other defendants also maintain their innocence, apart from Cid. He has collaborated with investigators as part of a plea deal and hopes to receive a reduced sentence.\\nIn an editorial marking the start of the trial, the O Globo newspaper said 2 September would go down in history as the day Brazil finally broke its “humiliating tradition” of failing to prosecute coup-mongering presidents and generals.\\n\\u200bThe judgment was celebrated as a “huge civilizatory leap forward” by the conservative O Estado de São Paulo\\u200b:\\n“Perhaps this is why Trump is using the enormous power of the US to attack the supreme court and save Bolsonaro from his penal fate. Not out of friendship [for the Bolsonaros], but to stop an example of democratic resistance flourishing in Latin America's biggest nation, that reinforces the contrast with the genuflection of American institutions to Trumpism.”\\nBolsonaro has been under house arrest since early August after the supreme court ruled he had violated a court order banning him from social networks. Police have been stationed outside his mansion amid fears he could flee to the nearby US embassy. Earlier this month police claimed they had found a document on a phone seized from the ex-president indicating he had planned to abscond to Argentina and seek asylum from its rightwing president, Javier Milei.\\nOn Sunday – Brazil's independence day – Bolsonaro's supporters are expected to stage a show of force, rallying in major cities to demand he be absolved. Security has been stepped up around the supreme court, presidential palace and congress to avoid a repeat of the 8 January uprising, when all three buildings were ransacked by Bolsonaro supporters.\\nMarques predicted there were likely to be lively days ahead as Brazil's 40-year-old democracy notched up another landmark moment. “This is an important cycle that is closing,” he said of the decade-long rise and fall of Bolsonaro, a once obscure politician who shot to prominence during the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, was elected in 2018, and now faces political annihilation.\\n“But the future is full of surprises,” Marques added. Even if Bolsonaro was convicted and jailed, “new chapters” could still be written, such as congress approving an amnesty, or a future rightwing president granting Bolsonaro a pardon. “Let's see what the future has in store for us.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.\\nFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro's closest allies – his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid – for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.\\nThere were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.\\nBolsonaro's former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.\\n“Today, Brazil is making history,” Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula's Workers' party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. “Brazil is saying: ‘Coups are a crime!'”\\nFabiano Leitão, a trumpeter who has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up\\u200b to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin's Funeral March that symbolised the former president's downfall. \\u200b“It's the end! It's the end of this guy!” Leitão\\u200b said as he pulled out his trumpet.\\nAfter playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician\\u200b \\u200blaunched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country's democracy, environment and minorities. “The extreme right is a mechanism\\u200b of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,” Leitão said. “Justice is done, comrades!”\\nBolsonaro's senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was “very surprising”.\\n“That's very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn't get away with it at all,” said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil's supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro's trial with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions.\\n“The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt\\u200b,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction “unjust”.\\nEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father's conviction.\\nIn a post on social media, Brazil's foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying “threats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio … will not intimidate our democracy”.\\nThe former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Brasília's foreign embassies.\\nProgressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux's questioning of the judges' authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial's annulment in the future.\\n“I wouldn't declare Jair Bolsonaro's political death,” said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.\\nRocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year's elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro's foes; petitioning Donald Trump to heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro's plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.\\n“I think they'll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,” she predicted.\\nIn recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Brasília. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.\\nBut Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an “incentive to illegality”. “It would send an awful signal – it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,” he warned.\\n• This article was amended on 12 September 2025 to reflect that at the time of first publication three out of five judges had convicted Jair Bolsonaro, but that was later updated to four.\"]"

         "[\"Angela* was cuddling her daughter in bed one afternoon when the then two-year-old said something she had never heard before.\\n“Kiss my bum?” she asked, lifting her bottom up.\\n“Don't be silly, I am not going to kiss your bum,” Angela said gently, kissing her own hand to transfer a kiss to the side of her daughter's bottom cheek.\\nShe then asked why her daughter had asked this.\\nHer daughter told her a male educator at the childcare centre she attended had kissed her private parts while changing her nappy.\\nThe next day, Angela says, her daughter disclosed further allegations of sexual abuse and again named the educator. A medical assessment added weight to Angela's worst fear: that she had been the subject of repeated sexual abuse at the centre.\\nAngela acted swiftly. She spoke to police, a GP, a mental health social worker, the childcare centre, and private and public sector investigators. She was confident her daughter's disclosure – supported by clinical notes showing the child had named the worker in the presence of a doctor before being urgently referred to a specialist – would be sufficient to have the educator removed from the system.\\nBut what followed has exposed the shocking shortcomings in Australia's childcare system that see hundreds of complaints about sexual misconduct by childcare workers ultimately dismissed, and regulators unwilling or unable to take action against alleged perpetrators if police decline to prosecute a criminal case.\\nAfter three separate investigations – a preliminary police investigation that stalled because Angela's daughter was not comfortable giving an official statement to officers, as well as one by a workplace relations company and the other by the Victorian education department – the conclusion was reached that there was insufficient evidence to remove the educator from his role. \\nThe complaint was, according to Victoria's reportable conduct scheme, “unsubstantiated – insufficient evidence”.\\nWhile the term appears to diminish the claim, technically the finding meant “there was significant strong evidence that supports the allegation, but the evidence falls short of being able to make a substantiated finding”.\\nWithout corroborating images, footage or another witness, the disclosure of a two-year-old to her mother – supported by a letter from mental health professional describing her symptoms as “consistent with sexual assault victims” – was not enough.\\nThis leaves the worker still employed, hundreds more children potentially at risk from a suspected paedophile and the family deeply troubled by the lack of action.\\nAngela's experience is an almost textbook example of one of the major failings afflicting the childcare system: an opaque, inconsistent, underfunded and often ineffective regulatory system.\\nThe federal government has rushed to act on children's safety in childcare services after the harrowing allegations of sexual abuse by a childcare worker in Melbourne, using the first week of the new term of parliament to introduce legislation that would allow it to strip funding from failing childcare services and conduct spot checks of centres.\\nBut experts have told Guardian Australia the problems run far deeper, and that the government risks introducing what amount to “reactive strategies” that won't address the real problems.\\nThey say that when complaints and allegations are made, they are assessed by state regulatory bodies beset with “irregularities and inconsistencies” when it comes to how they investigate and how they report allegations. These bodies appear to be hamstrung in taking action against individual workers if the police decide there is not enough evidence to criminally prosecute.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nWhen one mother in the Northern Territory arrived at her child's daycare centre to pick them up at the end of the day, she saw her three-year-old – through gaps in a fence – in an outdoor area.\\nThe child was standing between the legs of a seated male educator she had never seen before, who was rubbing the child's backside with his hands, according to a statement she would give to NT police, a redacted version of which has been seen by Guardian Australia.\\nThe mother immediately reported the incident to the centre and to police. NT police investigated but, according to their record of investigation, released under freedom of information laws, because there were no other witnesses and no CCTV footage, police concluded there was “not enough evidence” to prosecute and so declined to pursue charges.\\nThe early childhood education and care regulator for the territory – the Quality Education and Care Northern Territory (QECNT) – also launched an investigation.\\nBut ultimately QECNT concluded: “As police are not pursuing [the] matter, that QECNT could not take any further action, as there had been nothing to indicate the service should have taken a different course of action.”\\nBecause the centre had not breached any rules in relation to the allegation or its handling of it, and police weren't prosecuting the individual, there was no action the QECNT could take against him.\\nThe educator was a casual worker who had been placed in the centre by a temp agency.\\nIn the QECNT's log of the steps it took as part of its investigation, it noted that after the accused casual educator heard that police were closing the investigation, he had “phoned to state he has been cleared and requested to come back to work”.\\nThe log contains a summary of a conversation between the educator and someone, whose name is redacted but appears to be an employee of the temp agency, saying: “There have been some services that have requested he don't come back and she can't place him in those services … She indicated he may want to seek employment directly from a service” and that she would “keep him on the ‘books'.”\\nThe case highlights an problem that experts say is of concern when it comes to regulating childcare services: there is little that can be done about educators who are accused of serious incidents, including sexual abuse, but whom police do not prosecute.\\nWhile an individual daycare centre might then request that a casual worker not come back for any shifts, or bar them from working there, there is nothing to stop the educator from finding employment at another centre, nor any record that the individual has been suspended from or asked not to return to a previous place of employment.\\nThis is not a new problem. For years key players in the sector have flagged that childcare services have no way to act on, or keep records of, “unsubstantiated” complaints.\\nIn late 2023 the Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (Acecqa) conducted a review into the regulatory system. It found that such cases often came down to “a child's word against an educator['s]”.\\n“This often leads to unsubstantiated claims, where no further action is taken,” Acecqa said in its report to state and territory ministers.\\nIt said these individual workers, who could be deemed as “persons of interest”, provide a “unique challenge” from a regulatory monitoring point of view, because the sector doesn't have a clear system for tracking them.\\n“[Childcare services] have no way to share this information with another Approved Provider considering employing that person unless they are contacted as a referee,” it said.\\nThe federal education minister, Jason Clare, ordered the review after charges were laid against Ashley Paul Griffith, now known as Australia's worst paedophile. Griffith was found guilty last year of abusing 73 girls while working in childcare in Brisbane and Italy over two decades.\\nGriffith had also been the subject of previous allegations – one more than a decade before his arrest.\\nOne Brisbane mother claimed that in 2009 she went to police to report allegations that Griffith had sexually abused her son but they had not investigated.\\nShe told the Nine Network's A Current Affair that her four-year-old son had told her “Ashley hurt me” and went into graphic detail about the alleged sexual abuse.\\nShe took her son to a police station but claims officers only spoke to the boy for a few minutes, did not attempt to build rapport with him and, when he didn't disclose the abuse to them during the brief interview, says she was “advised that there was nothing to warrant further investigation, and it was over”.\\n“We left the police station feeling bewildered, disbelieved and possibly crazy.”\\nShe told A Current Affair: “We tried so many years ago to make it known that Ashley Griffith is a dangerous paedophile – no one listened, no one cared.”\\nA report into Griffith by the Queensland Child Death Review Board released this month found that concerns about reputation or legal risks may deter individuals from raising concerns within the childcare sector.\\nThe inquiry also found that more than one complaint was made about Griffith to his employers, the Early Childhood Regulatory Authority and the Queensland police, before his arrest.\\n“Of these complaints, the available information suggests they were not always progressed, and information was not shared between agencies,” the inquiry's interim report said. “Prior complaints made to QPS did not proceed to prosecution.”\\nThis meant that until Griffith's arrest, there was nothing to stop him maintaining his Blue Card – Queensland's working with children check.\\nIn its report to ministers, Acecqa recommended the government establish a centralised mechanism for sharing intelligence and keeping records so they could “monitor and respond to suspected misconduct and allegations about a ‘person of interest' who has unsubstantiated allegations”.\\nBut these warnings – and the same recommendations – have been sounded before.\\nAlmost a decade ago the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse noted that the inability to share information can enable perpetrators “to move between institutions and jurisdictions and pose ongoing risks to children”.\\nIt too made recommendations to ensure better information sharing, and for a consistent national approach for sectors including childcare, backed by legislation, to ensure children were protected.\\nSimilarly, the 2021 Tasmanian commission of inquiry highlighted concerns that individuals feared breaching privacy laws when sharing information about alleged abusers, while noting the need to collate information regarding all allegations and incidents of sexual misconduct – even if unsubstantiated.\\nAnne Hollonds, the national children's commissioner, says the federal government's proposal for a national register of childcare workers was an opportunity to address this enormous gap. But she argues that in developing the register, the government should consider whether it contains records of all serious allegations, substantiated or not.\\nShe acknowledges there are serious privacy and legal issues that need to be resolved before including unsubstantiated allegations on a national register, but also says it's an important way to identify a pattern of concerning behaviour.\\n“I think intuitively what I would say is that there should be a record … of reportable matters, whether substantiated or not.\\n“And I say that because it's when you look back on cases like the Ashley Griffith one that you see, maybe three reportable matters that were unable to be substantiated, maybe that's a sign of something, a pattern of behaviour, potentially.\\n“So then the question is: proactively, should we set the bar at a level that allows us to pick up a pattern in real time, even if not substantiated? … I'm asking that question. I don't know the answer. I think that needs to be considered.\\n“Given the difficulty of substantiation with non-verbal or barely verbal children, then what other measures should we have in place that are able to pick up a pattern of behaviour that might, in its quantum, be a sufficient cause for concern?”\\nHollonds says that assessment of who is suitable to care for children “shouldn't just rely on the working with children's check”.\\n“If we are prioritising the best interests of children … then we have to really address any barriers … for providers to be able to employ people who have a clean record, or to exclude those who don't,” which she says goes beyond people with criminal convictions.\\nOne mother who is all too familiar with the fact that a police conviction is not always possible is Jennifer*.\\nWhen she went to police to report that her then two-year-old daughter, Ava*, had disclosed she was sexually abused while at daycare, police repeatedly warned her that getting a conviction, or even laying charges against the alleged offender, was highly unlikely.\\nThe alleged offending occurred at a family daycare – a service run by an individual in their home, but which still receives the federal childcare subsidy – and the alleged offender was the partner of the woman running the service. Jennifer says she had no idea a man was living at the house where the children were cared for until Ava started talking about him.\\nEventually, Ava disclosed that the man had exposed himself to her and touched her private parts, Jennifer says. New South Wales police took statements from Ava and her parents and investigated.\\nThe Department of Education and the Department of Communities and Justice also investigated the allegations – but no charges were laid.\\nIn a summary of its findings, the education department wrote: “There was insufficient evidence to substantiate a breach of the National Law and Regulations. Insufficient evidence to determine [the alleged offender] posed a risk to children. No further action was taken by the department. The case was closed.”\\nNo action was taken against the man or the service, which is still operating, though Guardian Australia has not been able to confirm whether the man is still living at the premises.\\nJennifer would like to see reform to the way investigations into those working with children – or in close proximity to them – are undertaken, saying that the education department should be able to take some action against people who have had credible allegations made against them, even if the level of proof does not reach that required for a criminal conviction.\\n“That's a hard one because, you know, you don't want innocent people to be punished,” she says.\\n“[But] the level of evidence required for a conviction in court is so high; for beyond reasonable doubt. And when you've got no physical evidence and you've got the words of the two-year-olds, it's not going to stand up in court.”\\nWhen a report of a serious incident such as physical or sexual abuse is made against a childcare worker, multiple agencies swing – or should swing – into action.\\nIf criminal activity is alleged, police might investigate. The relevant state or territory regulator, often housed within the state's education department, will also receive a report.\\nBut data obtained by Guardian Australia through freedom of information laws show that responses and record-keeping vary wildly across the country.\\nSome jurisdictions, such as the NT, recorded just one or two reports of sexual abuse of a child in a childcare setting a year. Others, such as NSW, didn't separate out allegations of physical assaults and sexual abuse and so came back with hundreds.\\nThe responses also revealed that in the some states, in the vast majority of cases where allegations of physical and sexual assault of a child are reported and investigated, no action is taken by the regulator.\\nIn one state – South Australia – nearly 60% of the 147 reports of physical and sexual abuse of a child by a childcare worker from January 2020 until 31 October 2024 were not investigated by the regulator. It did not issue a single compliance notice (the strongest penalty which can include suspending a centre's right to operate or prohibiting a educator from working) for sexual or physical abuse of children in the nearly five years.\\nNSW had the highest number of reports of physical and sexual abuse of children in childcare centres to the state regulator, by a large margin, with, 1,856 incidents reported from 2020 until 31 October 2024.\\nInvestigations were launched into all of the incidents of alleged physical and sexual abuse reported to it. In 1,312 cases (70%), the investigation was completed and “no further action” was taken.\\nIn 13% of cases (244) administrative compliance action was taken, and in 180 cases (9.5%) statutory compliance action was taken. Other incidents were under investigation or handled in another case.\\nA spokesperson for the NSW Early Childhood Education and Care Regulatory Authority said: “We work closely with law enforcement and other agencies where required to support investigations. If a police investigation does not result in charges, we still conduct our own investigation and take strong action in line with the provisions of the National Law and Regulations.”\\nThe authority can bring prosecutions, and since 2021, it has prosecuted 34 providers, nominated supervisors and individuals, resulting in fines and conditional release, though none of these were in relation to sexual abuse allegations.\\n“I think one of the problems is we have a national quality framework and we're meant to have a nationally consistent approach … But because individual jurisdictions handle the monitoring and assessment of services, there are irregularities and inconsistencies across the country,” says Prof Marianne Fenech, an early childhood expert from the University of Sydney.\\nFenech says investment in quality education, including improving staffing levels and pay, and reducing the number of casual workers, was the hard work that needed to be done to improve the childcare industry, rather than the “reactive strategies” of CCTV and a national register that the government has suggested.\\n“If we just focus on reactive strategies to safety, we're missing the point and we're not going to deal with the bigger issues that are causing the safety problems in the first instance,” she says.\\nHollonds says in the last few weeks, as discussions have raged about safety in childcares and the government has introduced its new legislation, difficult conversations about reforming a huge, complicated industry are being had.\\nBut in many ways, this is all happening far too late, she says.\\n“Everyone is looking for answers. [But] it is a concern to me that we didn't work on these much earlier.\\n“These questions that you're asking me now, they are fundamental questions that go to the strength of the child safeguarding scaffolding underpinning the industry. And really, this should have been worked on many, many years ago … if not before then certainly the Ashley Griffith episode should have been the trigger for very proactive work on the regulatory system, making sure the regulators had the powers and the resources to do their job well, as well as all of these other elements that are being looked at now.\\n“I really don't understand why we've had to wait so long … before we acted.”\\n*Names have been changed\\n• In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help at Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

In 1979, she woke up in bed to find the serial killer Fred West on top of her. It was by no means the first time West had assaulted the 17-year-old, but it was the last. This time, she managed to escape from the room she was renting at 25 Cromwell Street, perhaps Britain's most notorious address, where Fred and Rose West raped, tortured and murdered so many girls and young women. Fred West took his own life in January 1995 while on remand, charged with 12 murders. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders later that year and is serving a whole-life sentence.\\nIn her own way, Richards has also been serving a life sentence. Today, she is a youthful, likable and traumatised 65-year-old. How could she not be damaged by all she experienced? Although she gave vital evidence at Rose West's trial that helped get her convicted, she never told the police what Fred had subjected her to. Nor did she tell her nearest and dearest. She couldn't. She didn't know how to. Now, almost half a century later, she has written a memoir, Under Their Roof, that does so much more than chronicle her time living with the Wests. It's a desperately sad insight into what makes someone vulnerable to abusers, and why victims are often abused multiple times by different people. But ultimately, this is a book about the triumph – however painful and even fluky – of good over evil.\\nWe meet at the London office of her publisher. She is with her daughter Hannah, here for support. Richards speaks with a broad Irish accent despite having spent most of her life in England. She is immaculate in an understated way – smart long shaggy bob, pristine white\\xa0shirt. Not surprisingly, she is nervous.\\nRichards' story starts in 1960, when she was born in Dublin to poor, uneducated, ferociously strict parents. Her father, who sold scrap and firewood from a horse and cart, spent what little money he had on himself, while his children were underfed, underloved and regularly beaten. She was the fourth of 10 and grew up sharing a bed with her siblings. At school her nickname was Smelly because of the urine-soaked clothes she wore. She kept the family home meticulously clean, but was never thanked for it. The only present she received from her parents was a naked, one-legged dolly her father had picked up at the dump that she called Polly and adored.\\nOne day in the summer holidays, hungrier than ever without the daily currant bun and glass of milk they got at school, she and her older sister Deirdre nicked some apples and ran for it. They found themselves in the grounds of a local factory, whose middle-aged caretaker told her he had a bag of sweets and would like to give her one. He took her into the hut and said she just had to do one little thing before getting the sweet. He put her hand in his trousers and made her masturbate him, and said next time he would give her a penny. After that, she returned time and again for her penny.\\nA year later, her maternal grandfather, who lived by himself after her grandmother's death, took Richards' hand and asked her to do the same thing for him. He also paid her a penny. With it she bought the sweets her parents denied her – Black Jacks, Fruit Salads, Catherine Wheels, Refreshers. But she hated what she was doing, and began to hate herself. “I told myself I was worth a penny. That's all. A penny. Or a potato.” On one occasion, her grandfather didn't have a penny so he paid her with a boiled potato. What made it worse, she says, is that neither man was overtly intimidating. “If they had shouted or threatened me not to tell anybody, I would have felt better about it; that I had no choice. But I did have a choice, didn't I? I went round there.”\\nOne day, she told her mother what her grandfather had been doing. “I said, ‘Mammy, Grandda's doing things to me. And I don't like it, Ma.' I didn't know how to say it, I didn't have the words. She just turned around, so angry with me, and said, ‘Get out, you!' I just ran out of that flat.” She never mentioned it to her mother again.\\nThe family moved from Dublin to a council house in Derby, then Gloucester. Even though they had far more room than before, Richards' mother told her when she was 17 that there was no space for her or 18-year-old Deirdre, who had just had a baby. That's when they moved into the home of Fred and Rose West, who were known for renting out cheap rooms. “People said he's a friendly, funny, nice guy. He'd help anybody. That's what he was known for. He'd give you a lift everywhere.” The Wests picked up a number of their victims in the car when they were hitching.\\nRichards will never forget the first time she met the family. “We thought we'd be safe because there were loads of kids. He brought us in and he stood there and said, ‘This is my wife, Rose, this is my lover, Shirley, and these are all the kids.' And my first thought was, yeah right, you wish she was your lover, because she was a young girl, really nice looking. She was 17, the same age as me.” Shirley Robinson later confirmed to Richards she was Fred's lover and that she was carrying his baby, but still she didn't believe her. How could a girl her own age be with somebody Richards regarded as an old man, and how could his wife have accepted it? The more she discovered about Rose West, the less she believed it possible. Richards says Rose was usually screaming at her husband or children. She found her terrifying.\\nRichards soon learned there were multiple versions of Rose. One was simpering and prissy. When Richards' mother visited, Rose would address her in a sugary voice verging on the infantile. Another was boisterous, over-friendly and inebriated. Then there was the Rose that most horrified Richards. One night, Shirley led Richards into the living room and Rose was lying on a sofa in a see-through nightie and garish makeup, watching hardcore pornography and smiling silently at her.\\nRichards and Shirley became friends. She says Shirley seemed sad and confused. She didn't appear to have a bedroom and would hang about on the landing. Late one night, she saw her going into the Wests' bedroom. This was her routine; she shared their bed.\\n* * *\\nOn their first day at Cromwell Street, Richards, Deirdre and her baby were taken by Fred to their shared room. There were large holes in the wall. They stuffed them with paper, but when they woke up, the paper had been pushed through the holes and was scattered on the floor. This happened every night. They wondered whether Fred was a dirty old man, but preferred to tell themselves it was a game the children played. He appeared inoffensive, comic almost. He walked with a fake limp and constantly forgot which leg he was limping on. He made daft jokes, and worked on his own in the cellar or outside, digging up the patio. Most of the day and night he appeared to be hammering and drilling. “There was definitely something a little odd about Fred, but he seemed harmless enough, like a real-life clown,” Richards writes in Under Their Roof.\\nShe soon discovered a darker side. In the corridor, Fred would stand in her way, tell her there was no room to pass, press himself against her and pinch her bottom. “Lovely arse, girlie,” he would say. The pinches became more violent and left her badly bruised. He would wait for Richards, lunge at her and demand kisses. She says he smelled of “dead animals” and it made her nauseous.\\nOn one occasion, Fred attacked her when she walked through the front door, shoving her into the wall and banging her head against it. His elbow was pressed into her throat, choking her. When she managed to scream, Shirley emerged from the living room and told him to leave her alone. Richards told Deirdre she was terrified of Fred. He never assaulted Deirdre, Richards believes, because her sister was a stronger character. They thought about leaving Cromwell Street but had nowhere to go.\\nRichards decided to tell the police, but when she got to the station she couldn't bring herself to go in. She sat outside crying, asking herself what she could accuse him of, telling herself she wouldn't be believed and she deserved it anyway because she had allowed herself to be abused all those years ago. Fred was a married man with children, he was popular, he probably had friends in the police. “I wanted to say he's doing things to me, grabbing me, and I thought they'd just say, ‘Is he? OK.'” Instead of going in, she returned to Cromwell Street.\\nShe and Shirley bonded over ice lollies. Richards was working at Wall's and Shirley loved red ice lollies. On Fridays, she would bring a little box home and they would hang out together eating them. Richards didn't understand Shirley, but she liked her. “Lovely, she was. Real gentle. She must have had some kind of life before she went there, God help her. See, there's always someone worse off than yourself, that's what I say. No matter what I went through, there's people worse.”\\nDoes she still think about Shirley? Richards swallows and struggles for words. “Yeah.” She starts to cry. “Yeah.”\\nHer daughter asks if she wants to stop, and passes her a tissue. “D'you want to go outside or are you OK?”\\nRichards blinks away her tears. “No, I'm OK.” \\n* * *\\nAfter Richards had been with the Wests for a few months, Shirley disappeared. When she asked Fred where she was, he told her she had gone back to family in Germany. Richards and Deirdre thought it was strange. She was just about to have his baby, why would she leave then? Why wouldn't she have said goodbye? How could she have afforded the flight?\\nThe assaults on Richards grew more regular and brutal after Shirley left. When Deirdre went to visit friends overnight, she dragged the chest of drawers against her door as protection. But it didn't deter Fred. Another day, when Deirdre and the baby were away, she unlocked her bedroom door to find him lying in wait for her on the bed (he had a spare key). This time, she was saved by one of his friends calling. “Fred West had pushed me on the bed. His hand was over my mouth.” She refers to him as Fred West rather than Fred. She says it creates more distance between her and him.\\nOnce when she tried to escape, Fred and Rose grabbed a hand each and bundled her back inside. A neighbour saw it but did nothing. Another time, when Fred was attacking Richards, her mother dropped by just in time.\\nAll this culminated in the most shocking assault, again when Deirdre and the baby were away. In February 1979, Richards woke up to find Fred in bed with her, his hands all over her. She begged him to let her go. He told her he would so long as she agreed to watch a “special video” with him and Rose, and then he said, “We will have some fun. You get my meaning?” She promised she would, and told him she needed five minutes to clean herself up. After he left her room, she crept to the front door, barefoot and in her pyjamas, nudged it open and bolted to the bus station to wait for Deirdre and the baby to return. When her sister's bus finally got in, she told her what had happened and said she could never return to Cromwell Street. Deirdre told her they would go back to collect their things and leave first thing in the morning. Richards stood guard all night. The next day, Deirdre moved to Derby to stay with her boyfriend and Richards moved in with her brother Danny.\\nAfter she left Cromwell Street, she met a man she liked. He became her first boyfriend and she got pregnant. Richards thought she was too young and messed up to have the baby, so she had an abortion, which led to the end of what had been a happy relationship. Soon after, at 19, she took an overdose. “It was still all in my head. I felt dirty. Ashamed. Worthless.” She thought of all the abuse: the caretaker, her grandfather, West. “I felt as low as anybody could feel. I felt the walls were closing in. What have I got to live for? It was just horrible. All I could see was Fred West's face. I was hallucinating and his face was there in my face staring, saying, ‘Come on, come on, come on!'” Her brother discovered Richards after she overdosed, and she was taken to hospital.\\nRichards recovered and moved back to Dublin. She went on to marry and have two children, John and Jess, with her first husband, Callum. When Jess was three, Richards and Callum separated. She says a contributory factor was her problems with intimacy – in bed, she was haunted by images of her abusers. She associated sex with control, pain and shame.\\nNow a single mother, she moved back to Gloucester; despite the memories of Cromwell Street, most of her family and friends still lived in the city. She and the children quickly settled down. John was at school, Jess was in nursery, and she was peeling onions for a chicken curry when the news bulletin came on the radio. It was early February 1994. The lead story was about a search for human remains in a house in Gloucester. The newsreader said, “Frederick West, aged 52, and his 40-year-old wife, Rosemary, of 25 Cromwell Street, have been arrested on suspicion of multiple murders.”\\nHow did she feel when she heard that? “Absolutely horrific. Complete shock.” She's welling up. “There weren't any words. I rang Deirdre, said hello and she said, ‘I know.' We didn't speak, just held the phone. I could hear her breathing. She could hear me. I was ill for a long time after that. Stomachaches, headaches. The shock affected my whole body.” She and Deirdre, who died last year, never spoke about West again.\\nAmong the victims, the remains of Shirley Robinson and her baby were found buried in the Wests' garden. “I thought about Shirley a hell of a lot after they found her. How come I didn't see that, why did I not know? A million questions.” She pauses. “I might have had that survivor's guilt,” she says with typical understatement.\\nHad she thought of Shirley in the intervening years? “Yes, I used to dream of her. She'd be knocking on my door with a baby in her arms.” She sniffs back her tears.\\nAfter the discovery of the remains, she saw her past life through a different lens. It became apparent that the Wests had been grooming her as Shirley's successor. “That's the scary bit,” Richards says. “I know that now, but obviously then I didn't.”\\nShe thought about the endless drilling and digging. “We thought he was building a swimming pool. We really did. I remember looking out of the window thinking, it's not going to be very big. To think what was actually happening, and we were laughing. It's sick.” She remembered how he had smelt of dead animals, and realised it was probably the stench of his victims.\\nDid she have nightmares? “I didn't have dreams. I didn't sleep much when it all came out.” For how long? “A long, long time.” She thought about it constantly when she was awake. When friends who knew she had lived there asked about it, she'd tell them she'd only been there a few days and seen nothing. But she had\\xa0lived there about 15 months and seen too much.\\nThe police asked for a witness statement. Richards didn't say she had been abused, but she told them all she knew about Shirley. Her son overheard some of the conversation and she had to admit to him she had lived in the house. “He ran in saying, ‘So you were living there?' I hadn't wanted the children to know.”\\nIt's amazing to have gone through all that and not burdened your family with it, I say. “That's the last thing you want to do, isn't it?” Well, plenty of people would, and it's incredible you didn't. Richards smiles. “Is that a compliment?” she asks. “Thank you.” What impact has experiencing such horror had on her life? Again she smiles. “I'm a very busy person. The house is sparkling.” \\nRichards went into the caring professions, working with elderly people in a home and fostering children. She says fostering in particular has been shaped by her life experience. “I thought I could help these children because I've been abused, I've been through a lot, maybe I can understand them. And I think I did. At Christmas, one of the social workers came round and saw the tree with all the presents and said, ‘I'm moving in here!'”\\n“She downplays herself all the time,” Hannah says. “I've just never wanted for anything, and nor did the foster children. I was given a perfect childhood.”\\nRichards looks at her tenderly. “D'you feel loved?” \\n“Every day!” Hannah says. “Every day! Of course I do.”\\nRichards says she never felt loved as a child. The opposite. Her mother died a couple of years ago. Did she soften towards the end? “No. And my dad was worse.”\\nYet she believes her mother probably saved her life. The Wests picked the most vulnerable people to be their victims – young women who weren't in touch with their families or were remote from them (as well as their own 16-year-old daughter Heather, Fred's first wife Catherine Costello and her eight-year-old daughter Charmaine). Only six of the 12 known murder victims had been reported missing. But the Wests knew Richards' mother was likely to ask questions. “I think if it wasn't for her coming every now and again, I would have been gone.”\\nOn 1 January 1995, after 11 months in custody awaiting trial, Fred West took his own life. How did Richards feel about that? “At first I was delighted. I thought: great, he's gone off the planet, he can't hurt anyone else. Horrible, evil man, you don't deserve to breathe the same air as us. Then a bit later it was, like, what about all those families? They're not going to get any justice now.”\\nIn November 1995, Rose West was convicted of 10 murders. She had claimed never to have met some of the victims buried at 25 Cromwell Street, including Shirley Robinson. Richards gave evidence for the prosecution contradicting that. “She sat there saying she didn't know Shirley, but she did. I knew that. So that helped convict her. When I was in the court, I kept looking over and thinking, I wonder if she remembers me. Then I was terrified in case she did remember and she'd go, ‘Yes, and this happened and this happened.'” Richards was so scared because she still hadn't told the police she had been abused by Fred.\\nHelping to secure Rose West's conviction gave Richards some comfort. But she continued to torment herself about the day she had not been brave enough to report Fred to the police. Even today she still seems to be doing so. “Someone might have listened to me in that police station. Someone might have checked it.”\\nAfter the trial, Richards continued with life as before – a great mum, always on the go, a much-loved carer and foster parent. She buried her memories as best she could. But abusers were still not done with her. By 2013, she and her second husband, Mike (Hannah's father), had grown apart, and they divorced. A few months later, friends encouraged her to go on dating websites. After two dates with one man, he started stalking her. This time, she did report it to the police. Two officers came to take a statement. The male officer, PC Darren Heath, returned to her house by himself the next morning. She thought he must have information, but he didn't. He started to turn up every day, making inappropriate sexual suggestions. Richards was now in her 50s and yet another man seemed bent on ruining her life. She hid when she saw him outside, and put her house up for sale. When he saw the sign, he uprooted it.\\nSix weeks after she reported the stalker, three officers turned up at her home. By now, she had lost all trust in the police. But this time it was different. They asked if she'd had any bad experiences with Heath, and told her he'd been reported for harassing vulnerable women who had sought police protection. This time she told them the whole story. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office by engaging in sexual relationships with three women he had met while on duty; he was sentenced to 45 months in prison. Another narrow escape.\\nThankfully, there is a happy ending to Richards' story. After Heath's conviction, she was offered therapy by the police, and for the first time she spoke about the guilt she felt that she was still alive and Shirley wasn't. She still didn't dare broach the subject of the abuse she had suffered. Meanwhile, she and Mike were becoming closer again. She told him she'd never stopped loving him and he reciprocated. In 2022, they remarried.\\nShe confided to Mike what had really happened to her at 25 Cromwell Street. Richards was still blaming herself. “When I told Mike the first time, I was in a bad way. I said, ‘If I'd only gone into the police station that day … ' and Mike was, like, ‘Well they wouldn't have listened to you. Another girl had gone to the police, and they didn't listen to her.'” This is true: Caroline Owens, one of the Wests' nannies, was abducted, raped and abused by the pair in 1973. She reported the crimes to the police, but the Wests inexplicably got off with a £50 fine. “It was only when he told me that that I thought, OK, maybe they wouldn't have listened to me.”\\nShe told friends about what she had suffered at the hands of Fred and Rose West. All were supportive. They told Richards her story could help others who have been abused. She began to understand why she'd been unable to talk about it. On the one hand, she was ashamed of what she had been through; on the other, she felt she hadn't suffered enough to consider herself a victim. \\nBut writing the book has been cathartic. “I was able to say something I've never been able to say today.” She looks so proud, but at the same time so diffident. What was it, I ask? “I was able to say I was sexually assaulted by him. I just said it out loud.” She comes to a stop. “I haven't healed yet, have I?” she asks quietly. \\n• Under Their Roof by Kathleen Richards with Ann Cusack is published by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown, at £22.

She did what many a lonely and frightened woman has done throughout history, on learning that she was going to have a baby, and pretended she wasn't. “If you don't think about it, it doesn't exist – something like that,” she told me, more than three years on.\\nBy the time she noticed the changes in her body, she had been homeless for nearly seven years. Before that, she had lived a comfortable, secure life in The Hague, with a man she had fallen passionately in love with. But the man had become controlling, she said, preventing her from working or seeing her friends, spying on her and eventually threatening her if she left him.\\nShe left him anyway, one night around Christmas 2014, and so opened a very dark chapter in a life that, to hear Romina, had already known its fair share of darkness – her parents' divorce when she was three; years of sexual abuse at the hands of a stepfather; her mother's many suicide attempts, the last of which, in 2009, succeeded; estrangement from her two half-siblings; and separation from her two sons (one of whom was just a toddler) after she entered into that last, abusive relationship, leaving them with their fathers.\\nHer ex had political clout locally, so Romina felt that the only way to prevent him from tracking her down was to disappear into the city's shadow world. The first night on the streets was the worst, she said. It was raining and cold. She didn't have enough money for a hotel, and the little she had, she knew she had to keep for food, so she walked, and cried. When she finally slept, after three wakeful days and nights, it was in a parking garage.\\nFor a woman alone, it can be a toss-up as to which is riskier, staying inside a homeless shelter or on the street, and except in winter, Romina preferred to take her chances outside. “It's strange,” she said, “but only six months were very hard, because you still have hope and you know a better life. After six months you don't know it any more, your brain goes into survival mode.” In her mind, all her ties of family and friendship fell away. Her sole preoccupations were finding food and a safe place to sleep.\\nRomina and I spoke via a video call, because she was still nervous about revealing her whereabouts. Her laugh is full-throated and her English excellent, given that she told me she learned it from Netflix. She has a mass of blond curls and was wearing red lipstick and had a tattoo the length of her forearm. She looked younger than her 42 years.\\nShe had two lifelines during those years, she said: an old school friend who let her wash and use the internet at his place when his girlfriend was at work, and Tinder, the dating app. She would have sex with men in exchange for a bed for the night. She was aware that sounded like sex work, but said she only chose men she found attractive. With one of those men the relationship was “Netflix and chill”. They always used a condom, but she got pregnant anyway.\\nBy the time it became impossible for her to deny her condition, the relationship was petering out, so she decided not to tell the man. She tapped a query into Google – “pregnant, homeless, what now?” – and up came a name she'd never seen before, Beschermde Wieg, which is Dutch for “protected cradle”. It was the name of a foundation that ran a number of “baby rooms” across the Netherlands, places where you could give up your baby anonymously, relinquishing – without judgment – any role in that baby's life along with any straightforward way for him or her to find you.\\nIn the moment, the anonymous option appealed to Romina. She fired off an inquiry, since the foundation also offered anonymous advice. That was how she entered into contact with the women who, by providing information and unflagging support, would help her turn her life around.\\nShe broke off from our conversation to reassure her son, now three, who was clamouring for her attention in the background. Like the vast majority of expectant parents who have enquired about baby rooms in the 11 years that they have operated in the Netherlands, Romina ended up keeping her child.\\nThe founders and staff of Beschermde Wieg insist that their rooms offer a caring alternative to the more controversial baby windows – also known as baby hatches, life windows or safe haven boxes – where a person simply deposits a baby in a secure vault, often in the wall of a public building, and walks away. To the dismay of many, this modern incarnation of the medieval foundling wheel has made a comeback since the turn of the millennium, proliferating in countries rich and poor.\\nBeschermde Wieg believes there are enough new parents in crisis – including victims of rape or incest, fugitives and the extremely young – that it's vital the option exists of giving up your baby anonymously.\\nAs Romina attempted to express her gratitude to the foundation, her English temporarily deserted her. Then she found the words. At the moment when her pregnancy forced her to act, she said, she trusted no one and had nothing to give. Without Beschermde Wieg, either she would have abandoned her child somewhere less safe, or she would be dead. “They saved us,” she said, simply.\\nInfant abandonment and infanticide – which are often mentioned in the same breath – are not subjects that most people like to think about. Even Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an anthropologist and professor emerita at the University of California, Davis, who studied them for years in the context of her wider interest in child-rearing, finds them hard topics to discuss now that she is a mother and a grandmother.\\nThough typically rare, abandonment is documented as far back as records go. There's plenty of evidence it predates history, too, and even the emergence of homo sapiens. Hrdy has argued that men and women are strategists hardwired to enhance their reproductive success. A pregnancy carried to term is a huge investment of resources, and usually the rational choice is to nurture and protect that investment. Very occasionally, however, circumstances arise that make the rational choice to write it off – as painful as that might be. Those circumstances include economic policies that separate new mothers from their support networks, and social conventions such as an extreme preference for sons. In her 1999 book, Mother Nature, Hrdy quotes a chilling note penned by a Roman soldier to his wife in the first century BC: “If you are delivered of child … if it is a boy keep it, if a girl discard it.”\\nNo country collects data systematically on abandonment, making it difficult to see what is driving it at a granular level. Newborn babies abandoned or killed before their existence is officially registered may, tragically, pass under the radar. We do know that abandonment reflects changes in the socioeconomic context. Today, abortion bans and crackdowns on illegal immigration are among the factors pushing it up. In the past it was principally lack of access to maternal care, stigmatising of single mothers, and poverty. Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist at University College London who studies abandonment, calls it a “lightning rod” for society's ills, because it's in childbirth – when humans are at their most vulnerable – that the strains show first and most dramatically.\\nSo many dead babies – more girls than boys – were being fished out of the Tiber by 1198 that a Roman church had a rotating cylinder fitted into its wall. A person could place a baby in the cylinder on the street side and rotate it into the building – abandoning the child anonymously. By 1400, foundling wheels were to be seen all over Europe. You can still see one at the Innocenti, a hospital turned museum in Florence, where the wheel is covered by a grille that was supposed to prevent people from shoving in older children. Indeed, Innocenti, along with Esposito (“exposed” in English, as in “left out”), were once surnames commonly given to foundlings.\\nBy the late 18th century, abandonment rates in many European capitals had peaked, shockingly, at about one in four births, and Hrdy has written of “epidemics of foundlings”. Misuse was suspected – birth parents presenting themselves as foster parents to collect monetary compensation, for example – and the windows began to be phased out, to be replaced in some countries by consignment offices where you were required to identify yourself. Maternity care and social services slowly improved. Methods of contraception other than abstinence became available from the 19th century, and legal abortion from the 20th – though, of course, not everywhere. Then in the late 1990s – for reasons including the decriminalisation of abandonment, and academic and media interest in the topic – the baby window was back on the scene.\\nThe typical baby window is a vault in the wall of a building – sometimes a hospital or clinic, sometimes a fire station or religious-run institution. Inside is a cradle and occasionally also writing materials in case the person depositing the baby wants to leave a note. They slide up a window, place the baby in the temperature-controlled interior and close the window again. They then have a few minutes to leave or change their mind, before the window locks and an alarm sounds inside the building.\\nToday, baby windows can be found throughout the world, though they are concentrated in regions where access to contraception and abortion is restricted. The US and Germany are outliers, with about 300 and 100 respectively. Most countries have many fewer, and the UK and France have none (the UK doesn't allow women to give birth anonymously, France does). In 2024, a woman named Toyin Odumala, who was herself abandoned as a child, launched a petition calling for baby windows to be introduced in the UK, in light of the highly publicised case of three siblings abandoned a few years apart in the same area of east London.\\nSister Ancilla runs the home for mothers and babies on a quiet residential street in Krakow, Poland. Financed by a Catholic charity, the Family Accompaniment Foundation, the home currently has four women and their babies in residence. But it serves a second function, having a baby window – a “window of life” as it is called in the country – fitted into the wall on the street side.\\nThe Krakow window was the first to be inaugurated in Poland, in March 2006, at the request of Pope John Paul II. Three months later it received its first baby, a girl; since then it has received 24 others – 12 of each sex, including two sets of twins. The abandoned babies spend no more than a few hours in the home – the nuns' role is to care for them until an ambulance arrives, and inform the family court so that the adoption process can get under way – nevertheless some of these modern foundlings have marked the sisters deeply.\\nOne premature girl was left in a shoebox, Sister Ancilla told me, wrapped in an old T-shirt, with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached – and, it transpired, drugs in her system. This was before Ancilla's time but, she said: “There was a presumption that it probably wasn't the mother who brought the baby. She wouldn't have been capable.” The nuns also suspected that the woman might have been a sex worker. The little girl survived, and Ancilla believes she went on to be adopted.\\nPoland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, and the Krakow window – like the dozens of others across the country – is advertised through churches and welfare associations. Over the years, police spokespeople have been quoted by local media as saying that the number of infanticides has dropped in the Krakow region since it was installed – the implication being that it is saving lives. A similar claim is made by Swiss Aid for Mother and Child, the non-profit organisation that runs six of eight baby windows in Switzerland, and by Safe Haven Baby Boxes, the company that has furnished all of the US baby windows.\\nBut the data doesn't really support these claims. Given that poverty is a known cause of abandonment, it could be rising incomes that have driven down infanticide in Poland – or lessening of the stigma attached to unmarried mothers. Sherr distinguishes between babies abandoned to live and those abandoned to die. Most experts agree that baby windows have no effect on infanticide rates, because forensic psychiatric evidence indicates that women who kill their babies – many of whom conceal or deny their pregnancies, then panic when they give birth – experience a degree of emotional turmoil that precludes the planning and problem-solving that using a window entails. They could reduce the number of babies abandoned to live, some of whom will die accidentally, but the data is ambiguous on this point at best. About 700 babies are given up in Polish hospitals each year, on average, compared with fewer than 10 via the baby windows. The hospital route is safer for mother and child, but not anonymous. Nobody can say what would happen to those 10 babies if the windows didn't exist, and women were better informed about their rights and options. They might be abandoned in unsafe places, or their parents might choose the standard adoption route.\\nThere is even some evidence that baby windows encourage the very thing they're designed to combat. When the Danish government was deliberating over whether to introduce them, it commissioned Laura Navne and Marie Jakobsen of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, in Copenhagen, to carry out a survey of the impact of baby windows in 10 high-income countries. The pair's startling conclusion, published in 2021, was that “they increase the incidence of child abandonment”. The government decided against installing them.\\nThe Danish finding echoes recent historical research conducted in Italy, showing that abandonment rates fell after the foundling wheels were phased out in the 19th century. The wheels provided both a solution for poor families with more children than they could support, the researchers found, and a secret, socially acceptable way of getting rid of babies born out of wedlock. In so doing, they entrenched the stigma attached to unmarried mothers, while fathers were unaccountable. Today's baby windows operate in a different cultural context, but they too have that dual function, the study's authors argued – protecting infants and perpetuating a system that fails to tackle the root causes of abandonment.\\nAbout 20 years ago, in an unpublished but much-cited anecdotal report, Hungarian child rights advocate Mária Herczog and colleagues interviewed porters at a Budapest hospital where visitors to the baby window were captured on CCTV. The hospital had the particularity of being located in the city's red light district, and the porters related that most of the 16 babies left there over the decade or so covered by the footage were brought by men. Who those men were, nobody knows.\\nIt's impossible to generalise from such a small and unscientific study, but it does serve as a reminder not to assume that the mother is the one giving up her baby, or even that she has consented to do so. For Herczog, the windows cynically exploit the most vulnerable women in society, since it is often the same women providing sexual services and babies for adoption. She called the devices “profoundly anti-mother” and said that many women end up giving birth in unsafe conditions before returning to bad situations where they quickly get pregnant again: “It is not a solution.” In her view, a humane society would intervene earlier, helping women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and supporting them through wanted ones. Sherr agrees. “I always say the mother of the abandoned baby is herself abandoned,” she said.\\nTo be fair, Poland's Family Accompaniment Foundation and Swiss Aid for Mother and Child try to intervene early, offering counselling and support. But both are – or are perceived to be – anti-abortion. The founder of the Swiss organisation, Dominik Müggler, did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article, but among the 33 reasons to have a baby, posted on the organisation's website, visitors can read: “Because God wants babies to live.” Herczog finds it telling that where the emphasis is on supporting mothers and keeping families together, as in the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, the windows (or rooms) stand mostly unused.\\nIn 2016, the Swiss canton of Valais installed a baby box that is funded, not by Müggler's organisation, but by the cantonal authorities, who wanted it to be ideologically and religiously neutral. Their aim was to reduce the infanticide rate, said the paediatrician who oversees the box, Juan Llor of the cantonal hospital at Sion, who was personally sceptical that it would have that effect. Since 2016, seven babies have been given up for adoption in the canton's hospitals, but not one has been placed in the box. “If the baby box is used, that's a failure of care for the pregnant woman and the family,” Llor said, adding that his initial scepticism had been vindicated: the window had had no impact on the Valais infanticide rate.\\nThe residents of the Krakow mother-and-baby home are in no doubt that an anonymous solution is needed. Several of them wrote me letters telling me how, though they couldn't have imagined giving up their own babies, they could easily understand women in situations only slightly more perilous than theirs choosing that path.\\nBeschermde Wieg, the Dutch organisation that Romina credits with saving her life, thinks it has found a happy medium – a way to offer anonymity humanely. It was founded by Barbara Müller, who previously worked in child protection, where she saw too many children let down by a dysfunctional care system, and concluded that more needed to be done early on, to keep families together. So in 2013, in her home town of Dordrecht, she set up a home where pregnant women or new mothers could find temporary accommodation and support.\\nA year later Müller decided that she still wasn't reaching the most vulnerable women – those whose desperate circumstances forced them to hide their pregnancies and to abandon or kill their newborns. She shared her frustration with her friend Kitty Nusteling, a mother of five who was working in the private sector then, organising childcare for middle-class families. Nusteling realised that she, too, would rather help women in greater need.\\nAt the time, around five abandoned babies were being found each year in the Netherlands, most of them lifeless. “And you can ask yourself the question, how many babies are not found?” said Nusteling. She and Müller felt that many new mothers in crisis might just need some respite, and that if they got it they would eventually – and joyfully – take their babies back. They decided to provide that respite, in anonymity and with no ideological or religious slant. “We're pro-choice, we're not pro-life,” said Nusteling.\\nUncomfortable with the somewhat brutal image of a hatch through which you pass your baby, never to see him or her again, they conceived of a room complete with child-friendly murals, cuddly toys and a sheepskin-lined rocking chair. A person couldn't give birth in the room, but they could spend undisturbed time there, settling the baby in and saying goodbye to him or her – also, importantly, browsing literature about the other options available – before pressing the button that would signal the baby's presence, and leaving. Since Müller's plan contravened Dutch law, which protects a child's right to know its origins – a right enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – she decided to keep the baby room separate from the mother-and-baby home so as not to expose the latter to legal risk. So Beschermde Wieg, of which Nusteling is director of operations, was born in the converted garage of a volunteer's house in Dordrecht.\\nThe law could apply to anyone seen as enabling or provoking anonymous abandonment, as well as to the person actually abandoning, and the punishment could include a hefty fine and jail time. Müller said that the first time a woman brought her baby to the room, she was invited to the justice ministry, interrogated and threatened with prison, but the threat didn't materialise. Eventually she was summoned to an official hearing at the ministry where she just kept repeating her line: “You are reading the UN convention in the wrong way.” In focusing on article 7, about a child's right to know their birth parents, she explained that officials had overlooked article 6, which defends a child's right to life. Müller argued that a person could only wonder about who gave birth to them if they were alive.\\nIn 2019, the government changed its stance. Though anonymous abandonment remained illegal, operating and using the rooms would no longer be punishable. The foundation even received funding from the Dutch health ministry after that, though nowadays it relies on private donations to pay for the 14 baby rooms – 13 fixed and one mobile – that it runs across the country, including nine in hospitals.\\nIf someone wants to give up a baby in the Netherlands, the official procedure begins with the child being placed with a foster family for three months. At the end of that period, the birth parents have an opportunity to change their mind. If they don't, the baby goes to an adoptive family, but the birth parents have a say in the choice of that family. Their identity is kept on record, and the child can obtain it, if he or she wants to, upon turning adult.\\nBeschermde Wieg respects this protocol scrupulously, but it inserts the extra option of anonymity. Many parents in crisis are drawn to the baby room, Nusteling said, but few ultimately choose it. Of the roughly 1,700 who contact the foundation each year, 17 give up their babies, around two-thirds of whom later reclaim them. The foundation's goal is to reach the mother as early as possible in the pregnancy, and to help her change her situation – to get an education, say, or to escape a violent partner. It wants the rooms to stand empty.\\nBeschermde Wieg was vilified to begin with, but as it shared more of the nameless women's stories, the criticism became more muted. “People saw over 10 years that there were not long queues of women wanting to give up their babies,” said Nusteling. “It's not easy.” They also saw that the women weren't all illegal immigrants – a common misconception. There were some of those, but there were also Polish women providing Dutch companies with cheap labour; young, unmarried Dutch women belonging to a strict Protestant denomination; and middle-aged ones like Romina, fleeing Dutch men with political influence. Perhaps, adds Müller, they also saw that there could be courage – and sense – in sacrificing your own desires to give your child a better life.\\nDuring Romina's first exchange with Beschermde Wieg, she agreed to a prenatal scan four days later. It was January 2022. “The next day it was very cold outside,” she said. “It was raining and all my clothes were wet.” She fell sick and called the foundation, which arranged for an ambulance to pick her up. At the hospital she learned that she was three months pregnant. Technically she could still have requested an abortion, but having seen what she saw on the ultrasound screen, she decided that was no longer an option.\\nFeeling trapped and frightened, her mind zeroed in on the baby room. Nusteling and her colleagues dissuaded her from taking an irreversible decision too soon, and she agreed to a period of foster care. She gave birth on a Friday, in hospital, by caesarean section. Given that she would only keep her baby for a few days, the medical staff advised her not to breastfeed him. “I did it sneakily!” she said. The following Monday, the foster parents came. Handing him over to them was the hardest thing she has ever done, she said, but she felt she had no choice. She was still homeless. If she didn't give him up, child protection would surely take him away from her.\\nShe spent the next three months in a psychiatric facility, half the time sedated to help her cope with the emotional maelstrom that losing her baby pitched her into. “The first three weeks were awful because your body is screaming for a baby but there isn't a baby,” she said. After six weeks she saw her son again, as the law required, and decided that she would do whatever it took to get him back. A judge agreed that she could have him, on condition that she found them a place to live. Beschermde Wieg's sister organisation offered her a room in one of its mother-and-baby homes, and when her son was three months old they moved into it, taking a single bag of clothes.\\nRomina has some outstanding debts to The Hague city authorities. She is on welfare and feels guilty that there is no father figure in her son's life. But she is slowly getting back on her feet, and has re-established contact with her older sons. Last Mother's Day, they came to visit. She shows me a picture of her middle son playing with his younger half-brother, her arms encircling them both. All three are smiling.\\nWhen her youngest starts school, in a year's time, she plans to find work. She and Nusteling have discussed the possibility of her joining Beschermde Wieg, to advise women going through experiences similar to hers. She knows it won't be easy – for a start, she's the perimenopausal single parent of an energetic three-year-old – but she can't get over how lucky she's been, or how surrounded she feels by kind people. “I have a beautiful home, I have food on the table, I have a shower, I have clothes,” she said. “Every day feels like a dream.” \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\"]"

         "[\"Pro-Palestine protesters will be legally protected while marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday after a New South Wales supreme court decision.\\nThe bridge is expected to be closed for about five hours, from 11.30am, and additional police are being mobilised to observe a march that could include up to 50,000 people.\\nIn her judgment, Justice Belinda Rigg said “the march at this location is motivated by the belief that the horror and urgency of the situation in Gaza demands an urgent and extraordinary response from the people of the world”.\\n“The evidence indicates there is significant support for the march.”\\nThe Palestine Action Group has claimed tens of thousands of people will take part in the march across the bridge, protesting against Israel's conduct in Gaza and the starvation of children. Celebrating the court's decision, organisers declared on social media it would be an “immense march for humanity”.\\nEarlier this week, police rejected an application from organisers for it to facilitate the march. Police argued there was not enough time to prepare a traffic management plan and warned of a potential crowd crush and huge disruptions.\\nSpeaking after the judgment, the NSW police deputy commissioner Peter McKenna said police were now switching to preparation mode.\\n“We don't get into the politics,” McKenna said. “We enforce the law of the day and tomorrow these protests have been deemed authorised, so we will police it in that respect.”\\nHe urged all participants to follow directions and said police would act on any antisocial behaviour. Public order and riot squad police, mounted police, traffic and highway patrol and other units were being called in to work, he said.\\n“Nothing changes for us in the fact that [if] people … come in to do the right thing and have a safe protest, then we will facilitate that … we will work with them.\\n“But if people come in to commit any type of offences, antisocial behaviour, or anything else that puts public safety at risk, we will have no hesitation to take action.”\\nOfficials were expecting significant disruption to roads and public transport. Trains will still run across the bridge, authorities said.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nOnce the application known as a “form 1” was rejected by police, the supreme court was required to decide whether the protest should be considered as “authorised”, which provides some legal protections to demonstrators.\\nRigg said the fact the demonstration was likely to cause significant inconvenience to residents and others “is far from determinative”.\\n“If matters such as this were to be determinative, no assembly involving inconvenience would be permitted,” she said.\\n“To deprive such groups the opportunity to demonstrate in an authorised public assembly would inevitably lead to resentment and alienation.”\\nRigg noted submissions from Palestine Action Group's spokesperson, Josh Lees, who told the court a demonstration on the bridge would send an “an urgent and massive response” to the crisis in Gaza.\\n“The public interest in freedom of expression, at this time, in the manner contemplated, for the reasons advanced, is very high,” Rigg said.\\nRigg rejected any suggestion that her decision would condone any antisocial behaviour or violence at the demonstration or “ambulances not getting to hospital on time”.\\nIn a statement, the Palestine Action Group described the court decision as “absolutely historic”. The group said it would provide further instructions to demonstrators before noon on Sunday.\\n“This will be an enormous, family-friendly and safe event for everyone. The police are now working with us.”\\nThe court ruling means protesters will have immunity from being charged under the Summary Offences Act. This includes protection from offences like “obstructing” traffic – crucial in this particular protest.\\nHowever, police will still have access to a range of other powers to stem so-called “antisocial behaviour” or other types of offending. This includes showing prohibited symbols.\\nThe state police minister, Yasmin Catley, said the government “accepted” the decision.\\n“Police, we believe, will be able to handle the protest on the bridge tomorrow, so long as people are peaceful, that they listen to what the police ask them to do,” she said.\\n“But make no mistake, there is going to be massive, massive disruption. So our message is, avoid the city if you can.”\\nDavid Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the authorisation “doesn't give people the ability to engage in all types and all forms of activism”.\\n“It's really important for people who do attend that they follow the directions of organisers and marshals.”\\nRigg said a counter-protest against antisemitism, organised by the Christian-led group called Never Again is Now, would not be granted legal protections because “notice was served less than seven days before the proposed assembly”.\\nThe group had been planning to protest outside the Sydney harbour tunnel, in close proximity to the pro-Palestinian march. Rigg said police would have the legal power to direct this group to move on, or if necessary, arrest demonstrators for non-compliance.\\nThere is no authority to ban protest or deem it unlawful in NSW. This is because while there is no express right to protest in the state, it is covered in common law and by the Australian constitution, which the high court has found implies the right to freedom of political communication.\\nThe decision came after several NSW Labor MPs defied their premier, Chris Minns, by vowing to attend the march. Minns had earlier opposed the protest and said “we cannot allow Sydney to descend into chaos”.\", \"The contingent of neo-Nazis arrived at Flinders Street station about an hour before Sunday's anti-immigration rally was due to start.\\nA hundred or so men, dressed in black, strode across Princes Bridge in a bloc, weaving through the large crowd that had already gathered under a sea of Australian flags.\\nPlenty of people in the lead-up to the so-called March for Australia on Sunday, and many who attended, said that the widespread promotion of the rally by known neo-Nazis did not mean it was organised by them; or that the presence of the National Socialist Network (NSN) in the crowd did not mean it was central to the day's message.\\nEven if they were there, some said, you didn't have to agree with everything they said in order to attend.\\nIn Melbourne, however, neo-Nazis were not just central to the march, they led it, all the way to the steps of parliament. And the NSN leader, Thomas Sewell, when he addressed the crowd to huge cheers, clearly laid out the role he envisioned for “my men” in the “fight for [Australia's] survival” against “ginormous empires of the third world”.\\nMembers of the group went on to attack a First Nations protest site, Camp Sovereignty, in Melbourne's Kings Domain on Sunday evening.\\nIn Sydney, too, the New South Wales leader of the group spoke to cheers of “send them back” from onlookers as Australian flags flew in the background. Pamphlets were handed out for a far-right political party about the “plague level” of immigration.\\nAustralia's immigration figures are not at record highs. The government says the net overseas migration figure is down 37% from a recent peak.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nIn some cities, politicians spoke at the rallies. In the lead-up, parts of the media interviewed march organisers and showed the flyers on television.\\n“It was only about recruitment,” said Mario Peucker, an associate professor at Victoria University, of the presence of far-right figures on Sunday. “It was an opportunity to mingle with people who basically [are] their target group … presenting themselves as the only voice for them.”\\nVictoria police said it was too early to confirm whether the attack on Camp Sovereignty or any of the other activity complained about at the rally would be investigated as “prejudice-motivated”, the force's term for offences that could also be described as hate crimes.\\nThe first mentions of a “March for Australia” came after the Palestine Action Group's March for Humanity, when massive crowds (police estimated 90,000 but organisers said the figure was closer to 300,000) walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on 3 August to oppose Israel's actions in Gaza.\\nOnline, the event incensed several high-profile nationalist accounts, one of which made AI-generated images of the bridge covered in Australian flags.\\nSoon a TikTok video emerged from an anonymous account. Over stock footage of Australian flags, it called for rallies on 31 August: “We finally stand up for ourselves and take this country back.” The clip included footage from the 2005 Cronulla race riots.\\nA woman who goes by the name Bec Freedom online claimed to be in touch with the video creator, “a young kid”. In early August, she began responding to tweets from One Nation's Pauline Hanson and various online influencers with a poster calling for Australians “to rise” on 31 August.\\nIn an X space on 11 August (where live audio conversations occur on the X platform), Bec said messaging should follow certain steps: “So, protect Australian heritage, culture, way of life. Next step, protect European culture, heritage, way of life. The next step is protect white heritage. So it all means the same thing.\\n“By saying it that way, it is more appealing to the public. It's going to deter them from saying, ‘Oh, it's a Nazi rally, blah, blah, blah'. ‘Australian' is white.”\\nIn response to questions from Guardian Australia about the comments, Bec said: “Am I a nationalist? Yes. Am I white? Yes. So I guess I'm a White Nationalist.”\\nThe March for Australia website launched on 8 August and the ABC reported that an earlier version of the March for Australia websites included a reference to the white supremacist concept of “remigration” – the forced return of immigrants back to their country of origin. The ABC report makes clear it had been unable to establish exactly who was responsible for the website.\\nAs the date approached, there was confusion about who the organisers of the rallies were in each state, although statements on the March for Australia Facebook page distanced the events from white supremacists.\\n“In particular, recent claims by Thomas Sewell of White Australia are not reflective of the organisers nor the politics of March For Australia. We are not associated with their organisation,” it posted on 12 August.\\nIn a video on 22 August, Bec said she and other organisers were not members of any extremist group, and were not endorsing violence. “All we are doing is gathering en masse to fight for Australia,” she said.\\nThe rallies also brought together many elements of the pandemic-era anti-lockdown movement and others, but despite the messaging of the March for Australia accounts, Nazi groups clearly intended to capitalise on the events, with the NSN group White Australia issuing a press release in the lead-up claiming to have “positive ongoing contact with the event organisers nationwide” and promising that members would be speaking at March for Australia events.\\nBec said she was not in contact with anyone from White Australia. On the question of whether the marches were sites of neo-Nazi recruitment, she said it was “irrelevant to myself or March For Australia”.\\n“I can't comment on what took place in Melbourne, as I publicly withdrew from any organisation of the event,” she said. “But no, they [the NSN] were not invited to speak at the Sydney event, they took part in the open mic section after the designated speakers.\\n“The March For Australia events were for all Australians, no one was banned from attending.”\\nShe said there were plans for future events.\\nThe rallies come amid growing anti-immigration protests in the UK as well as the Trump regime's raids and deportation of migrants.\\nThese ties were recognised in March for Australia messaging, with the main account posting on Instagram in support of Operation Raise the Colours. This movement urges members to raise British flags around the country and post photos, and the 31 August events in Australia was praised in turn by British “patriot” accounts.\\nAurelien Mondon, a UK-based academic who attended the recent protests there, has written extensively about how immigration is often used by those on the far right to appeal to the mainstream.\\nHe also says it is important not to describe such movements as “populist”, even when they involve the support of politicians.\\n“When we allow the far right to be described as populist, we are incorrectly implying that they are tapping into what the people want or that they speak for the ‘silent majority',” Mondon and a fellow academic, Alex Yates, wrote in a piece for the Conversation last year.\\nIn February, Mike Burgess, Asio's director general, used his annual threat assessment to outline the spectre of the far right. “We expect nationalist and racist violent extremists to continue their efforts to ‘mainstream' and expand their movement,” he said.\\n“They will undertake provocative, offensive and increasingly high-profile acts to generate publicity and recruit.\\n“While these activities will test legal boundaries, the greatest threat of violence comes from individuals on the periphery of these organised groups.”\\nThere was a range of grievances on display about perceived immigration rates on Sunday, but it was clear for many that the return to an imagined white Australia was a central theme.\\nFor Jordan McSwiney, who researches the far right at the University of Canberra, the weekend's rallies brought to mind the 2015-17 anti-Islam and anti-immigration street protests of Reclaim Australia.\\nThis time, however, far-right groups were not shielding their involvement.\\nMcSwiney noted how “easy it has been for the NSN to basically use the shield of ‘ordinary mums and dads' to sell white supremacy to a big crowd of people who may very well have genuine concerns … that won't be fixed by stopping immigration.”\\nIn his view, the recent response of state and federal governments to these movements – banning known Nazi symbols, for example – has been a distraction, and has not made it meaningfully more difficult for neo-Nazis to organise and recruit in Australia. As has been the “softball condemnations” of some politicians in response to the rallies – and the presence of others.\\nFor Peucker, Sunday's rallies represent a new escalation that demonstrated how the views of some who consider themselves “part of the ordinary Aussie mainstream” overlap with the political agenda of openly white nationalist groups.\\n“It's not that white supremacy, which was present clearly yesterday, is something that the neo-Nazis in some evil, secretive fashion introduced into the political mainstream,” Peucker said. “It is something that has always been present in parts of the mainstream.”\", \"The text messages circulating around Sydney's Sutherland shire in early December 2005 explained precisely the purpose of the gathering. “Just a reminder that Cronulla's 1st wog bashing day is still on this Sunday,” one read. “Chinks bashing day is on the 27th and the Jews are booked in for early January.”\\nOn Sunday 11 December, more than 5,000 people, mostly young men, swarmed Cronulla beach. They wore Australian flags as capes, they had drawn the Eureka flag on their bodies. They were drinking alcohol and they were chanting – and they were beating up anyone who wasn't white.\\nWhile tensions had been growing in the area for months, the catalyst had been a fight between three off-duty lifesavers at North Cronulla beach and a group of eight men of “Middle Eastern appearance”. The 2GB radio host Alan Jones was outraged as his listeners told stories of the “lebs” and “wogs” at the beach, and he said he was in favour of “a rally, a street march, call it what you will. A community show of force” and urged his listeners to attend. Police said 26 people were injured, 104 arrested and 285 charges were laid.\\nMemories of what happened on that southern Sydney beach nearly 20 years ago provoked anxiety among migrant communities even before last Sunday's so-called “March for Australia”. But they have been recalled by many more in the aftermath of the neo-Nazi-led demonstrations, in which volatile confrontations culminated with dozens of black-clad men, including known fascists, allegedly attacking people at Camp Sovereignty, a longstanding First Nations protest site in Melbourne's Kings Domain. Three men were charged. \\nThe association between Cronulla and the March for Australia isn't entirely accidental. The anonymous TikTok video that called for anti-migrant rallies on 31 August coupled stock footage of Australian flags with news footage from the Cronulla race riots.\\nWhy was Cronulla a touchstone for the organisers of Sunday 31 August? Did we witness a repeat of it, or was it a marker of something worse? And what does it say about the prevalence of Australian racism?\\nCamp Sovereignty is a place that marks the dead: 38 Aboriginal people from around Victoria are buried there, their remains repatriated in the 1980s by Museums Victoria. The camp is both a vigil and a protest against the colonial infrastructure that continues to sideline the slaughter of Indigenous people: there is no memorial but a plaque set into a granite boulder. No path leads there from the road; no prominent signage points to it. A victim of Sunday's violence, who spoke to Guardian Australia, noted the grim symbolism of a white nationalist attack on such a site.\\n“Australia is an institution of racism,” the Camp Sovereignty founder, Krauatungalung elder Robbie Thorpe, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “It's the institutions of this country that have allowed this to manifest. They're running around saying stop immigration; they're immigrants themselves.”\\nAustralia has a long history of white nationalism, from the systemic violence inflicted on Indigenous people from the early days of British colonisation, to the White Australia policy and, more recently, its brutal offshore detention regime. Pauline Hanson expressed fears of being “swamped by Asians” in her first speech to parliament in 1996. A few years later, the then prime minister John Howard, facing re-election in the wake of 9/11 and the Tampa crisis, proclaimed: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”\\nThe problem of racism in Australia is as bad as it ever was, Australia's race discrimination commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, tells Guardian Australia.\\n“The racist violence keeps on pouring out on to our streets on a regular basis and we're so quick to forget the last time it happened,” Sivaraman says.\\n“During Covid, we saw a huge increase in racism towards people of Chinese and Asian origin, including racist violence. During the voice referendum, we saw a mainstreaming of racism towards First Peoples. In the last year-and-a-half, we've seen a huge increase in antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism, and now, in the last few weeks, we've seen a huge increase in anti-Indian racism.\\n“Interpersonal racism is prevalent and our structures are allowing this racism to happen and in some cases encouraging it.”\\nSivaraman says he has “lost count” of the number of people from migrant communities who have told him over the past few weeks that they were scared, or feeling vulnerable, or unsure what to do. Members of Australia's south Asian migrant community also described to Guardian Australia their shock and fear in the lead-up to the rallies.\\nJana Favero, the deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, agrees multicultural communities in Australia feel exposed and insecure.\\n“This country doesn't need to have a debate about immigration, it needs to have a debate about racism: it is something this country has never reconciled.”\\nWhile the noisy minority of neo-Nazis on the streets of Australia's capitals dominate news headlines, there is a disconnect with the broader Australian public. The electorate, at this year's election, resoundingly rejected the politics of fear and division, not only rejecting Peter Dutton from the prime ministership but voting him out of parliament entirely.\\nPolice estimate a total of 21,000 people participated in the March for Australia. Those numbers were dwarfed by the scale of the Palestine solidarity movement – between 90,000 and 300,000 marched in Sydney alone on 3 August – but they are not insignificant. And while both the Cronulla riots and the March for Australia were widely seen as racist, they differed in one important respect: the significant presence of organised fascists.\\nIn 2015, the far-right group Reclaim Australia held a series of anti-mosque demonstrations. The group presented itself as ordinary “mums and dads” but never quite managed to hide its neo-Nazi links. Hundreds attended their rallies, and politicians gave them a thin veneer of respectability: the then federal government backbencher George Christensen spoke at the Mackay rally, Pauline Hanson in Brisbane and later Rockhampton.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nThe group quickly collapsed into infighting, and subsequent fascist groups struggled to transform far-right sentiment online into a mass mobilisation. Now, however, they seem increasingly confident about heading on to the street.\\n“I think these guys are a lot more organised,” says Clement Fermier*, a spokesperson for the Australian antifascist research collective White Rose Society. “They have a plan and they started to enact it.”\\nPrior to the March for Australia announcement, there had been “months and months of neo-Nazi news sources seeding any story about ethnic crime into these freedom movement spaces, and priming people for, ‘oh we need to do something about all these non-white people',” Fermier says. The March for Humanity was the catalyst for mobilising them.\\nAs with Cronulla, the mainstream media contributed to publicising the events last Sunday, even as the neo-Nazi connections became clear. And as with Reclaim Australia, some politicians got directly involved. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and party member Senator Malcolm Roberts attended in Canberra, and the federal MP Bob Katter spoke at the march in Townsville.\\nThe protests were condemned as hateful by the federal government, but Anthony Albanese also said he had “no doubt” that “good people” would have been among the crowds – a comment that for many recalled Donald Trump's much maligned comments that there had been “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, and one that was rebuked by the prime minister's own backbench.\\nAmid growing debate in federal parliament this week about immigration policies and the rise in far-right activists objecting to multiculturalism, the Liberals were also caught in the crossfire when the firebrand Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price claimed Labor was bringing Indian migrants into Australia to boost its electoral chances.\\nPrice described the March for Australia as “a pro-Australia march” attended by “quiet Australians” and a “demonstration of unity”.\\nThe comments also undercut moves by the Coalition to reconnect with culturally diverse constituencies, and a bid by the shadow immigration spokesperson, Paul Scarr, to draw a line under the opposition's harsh anti-immigration rhetoric deployed under Peter Dutton.\\nReclaim Australia attempted to paper over its fascist elements, but at the March for Australia members of the neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network removed their masks, figuratively and literally.\\n“In the recent past, they haven't been able to get out on the street the way they'd like to because they don't have the numbers. They have had to go out in the middle of the night to do their stunts,” Fermier says. “[But] this was out in the middle of a day in the city, and it's because they managed to rope enough people in to protect them.”\\nThe longterm consequences remain to be seen. Leading members of the NSN face serious criminal charges, while different elements of the far right squabble online and some attempt to distance themselves from the overt Nazis. The new manifestation of the right may yet fall apart.\\nBut the events of the past weekend show that a serious reckoning with Australian racism is ever more urgent, Sivaraman says.\\n“People only engage with this kind of open violence if they think they're going to get away with it or they think they've got the support to do it. And that's an enormous concern. That shows we've got a really serious problem.”\\n* A pseudonym\\nAdditional reporting by Ben Doherty\\nThis article was amended on 7 September 2025 to remove an incorrect reference to the Tampa sinking. \\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according to Home Office data.\\nThe data also shows that the government is processing asylum applications much more quickly, with 71,000 cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two years ago.\\nThe figures come amid growing clamour from councils to block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex should be removed.\\nThe high court judgment has led to ministers bracing for further legal challenges from across the country and pressure on the government to find other places to house people.\\nThe latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour's first year in office.\\nThere were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.\\nThe latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories.\\nFor the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021.\\nIn the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people – up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences.\\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the government's first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster.”\\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “The action we have taken in the last 12 months – increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system – are crucial steps to restoring order, and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous government.”\\nOn Tuesday, the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell hotel.\\nAbout 140 asylum seekers must leave the hotel by 12 September after the high court imposed a temporary injunction against them staying there.\\nThe Labour-run Wirral and Tamworth councils are among more than 10 that are reportedly considering legal challenges to close hotels housing asylum seekers in their area.\\nOn Tuesday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, named three Conservative councils that were considering legal action in efforts to shut down asylum hotels in their areas.\\nAsked how many Tory councils were considering legal action, he told BBC Breakfast: “There are certainly a number who are actively considering it. Broxbourne, which is next door to Epping, is one of them. I think Reigate and Banstead is another, Hillingdon is yet a third.\\n“So, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at this following the Epping ruling.”\\nWhitehall sources said the government was expected to appeal against the Epping ruling.\\nCharles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Starmer's shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal.\\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed” but without indicating which ones.\\n“I very strongly urge the government – I don't know what they're going to do – to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed … and which shouldn't, secondly to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly to deal with this very troublesome issue: namely, do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely that they will be closed,” he said.\\nThe Democratic Unionist party (DUP) is also seeking to remove asylum seekers from hotels in Northern Ireland after the landmark ruling in England.\\nAntrim & Newtownabbey borough council has launched an enforcement investigation into the use of the Chimney Corner in Mallusk to house asylum seekers after a complaint by the DUP Stormont assembly member Trevor Clarke.\\nThe party – the second-biggest in Northern Ireland – would also lodge complaints about the other two hotels that house asylum seekers in two other council areas, Clarke said.\\nWednesday's high court ruling that the Bell hotel in Essex cannot be used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules paved the way for similar legal challenges, Clarke said.\\n“Housing asylum seekers in hotels without first securing a ‘change of use' through the proper planning process (from hotel to hostel or immigration centre accommodation) constitutes a breach of planning regulations. No one is above the law, not even government departments. If the Home Office or its contractors wish to place large numbers of illegal immigrants into our communities, they must follow the same planning rules as everyone else.”\\nThe other hotels that house asylum seekers in Northern Ireland were in the Causeway Coast and Glens and the Ards and North Down council areas, the Irish News reported.\\nHome Office spending on asylum in the UK stood at £4.76bn in 2024-25, down 12% from a record £5.38bn in 2023-24, government figures show. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration and borders activity.\\nAsylum seekers and their families can be housed in temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation, if they are awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved and there is not enough longer-term accommodation available.\\nWhen there is not enough housing, the Home Office, which has a legal obligation to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, can move people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites, such as former military bases.\", \"Good morning. Anger at the use of hotels to house asylum seekers has been bubbling all summer, sparking protests across the country, some of which have turned violent.\\nFar-right agitators have been licking their lips at the prospect of another wave of anti-immigrant riots to force a change in asylum policy. But the move away from hotels may be hastened by something far more mundane yet powerful: planning law.\\nThis week, Epping Forest district council became the first local authority to win an interim injunction blocking asylum seekers from being placed in a local hotel, leaving Home Office officials reeling and prompting questions about further legal challenges.\\nThe ruling has been seized on by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who said the party's 12 councils would consider similar challenges. He also urged protests outside hotels across the country, hoping to replicate the “template” set by Epping Forest.\\nIf a string of councils succeed in closing down hotels, the Home Office might have to find alternative housing for thousands of people at short notice – forcing the politically explosive question of where that should be.\\nSo how did we get here, and can the government get itself out of this mess? To answer those questions, I spoke with Rajeev Syal, the Guardian's home affairs editor. That's after the headlines.\\nGaza | Israel has announced it is expanding its military operations in Gaza City, as the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned its approval of a huge new illegal settlement in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law.”\\nUK news | Labour is preparing to kick off a new wave of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in England to build the neighbourhood health centres at the heart of its NHS 10-year plan.\\nUkraine | Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine's security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump's push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\nTechnology | Scotland Yard's plan to widen the use of live facial recognition technology is unlawful because it is incompatible with European laws, the equalities regulator has claimed.\\nHousing | England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were constructed the previous year, research has found.\\nWhen Rajeev spoke to a Home Office official on Monday about the case lodged by Epping Forest, “they were quite relaxed”, he tells me. “That changed the next day when the verdict came out.”\\nHe explains that the challenge centred around the argument that the owners changed the purpose of their hotel without informing the local council. The hotel had first changed into an asylum hotel, which was used to house asylum seeking families; then it changed again to an asylum hotel housing young men. The council argued this occurred without planning permission.\\nRajeev says the Home Office is right to be worried as the ruling has significant implications. “The 140 people staying in this hotel, unless there's a successful challenge, have to be moved out on 12 September at 4pm.\\n“It shows that if a council challenges the use of the hotel in similar fashion, it could take just a month from the start of the challenge to getting people out. And if lots of councils managed to do that, it could land the Home Office with the job of rehousing thousands of people at short notice.”\\nBut how did we end up here in the first place, with hotels as the main form of housing for so many asylum seekers?\\n***\\nHow did we get into this mess?\\nIn 2020, the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels was about 1,200. By 2023, more than 55,000 people seeking asylum (pdf) were living in them. The number has since fallen from that peak to about 30,000.\\nThe uptick stems from a ban on asylum seekers working, which was implemented in 2003, following criticism from the rightwing press that migrants were taking jobs from British people. Perhaps counterintuitively, this resulted in the government becoming legally obligated to provide accommodation for asylum seekers who, without the right to work, would otherwise end up on the streets.\\nThis is not exclusive to migrants. Councils must support Britons and other residents who are destitute and come forward as homeless. Asylum seekers who are housed and fed by the government receive £10 a week in spending money.\\nThe use of hotels specifically is another problem passed over from the previous government. As journalist Daniel Trilling explains in this informative piece, accommodation was once largely provided by local councils' housing departments, but this was privatised during the Cameron-Clegg coalition government's austerity drive. Privately run asylum accommodation then became the subject of growing scandals, with allegations that much of it was unfit for human habitation. Slowly, the government became increasingly reliant on hotels and other forms of short-term housing.\\nThis shift coincided with the Conservative government's failed attempt to rewrite asylum law. Ministers sought to make it illegal to apply for asylum after arriving through irregular routes, such as crossing the Channel in small boats, by stipulating that applicants would be deported to Rwanda.\\nConservatives now claim that this crisis is unfolding because Labour removed the Rwanda policy, which was meant to act as a deterrent. Rajeev disagrees. “There was no proof that Rwanda proved to be a deterrent. The numbers of people coming over increased over those three years, before Rishi Sunak left office,” he says. “Over that period, the numbers of people in hotels went up.”\\n***\\nWhat are the options?\\nThe options facing the Home Office now – if hotels are suddenly forced to stop housing asylum seekers – are politically toxic.\\n“They come down to putting people in flats or houses, in what's known as multiple occupancy housing (HMOs), or in large-scale sites such as barracks,” Rajeev says.\\nBut using that kind of accommodation for asylum seekers has also sparked protests. This month, plans to house 35 families in flats above local shops in Waterlooville, in Hampshire, have been scrapped after more than 1,000 residents gathered for an anti-immigrant protest, calling on the government to “stop the boats”. Critics also argue the policy risks adding further strain to the rental market, where competition for housing is already intense and rents have risen sharply.\\n“Barracks come with political implications too. When Labour were in opposition, they were critical of barracks,” Rajeev says. The Bibby Stockholm, a converted barge in Portland, Dorset, was decommissioned in November 2024 by the Labour government after safety concerns and protests.\\nThat said, Rajeev adds, this hasn't stopped the government quietly expanding the use of Wethersfield, an airbase in Essex, as a place to house asylum seekers.\\nThe government could still win on appeal against Epping's decision, arguing that the issue is national in scope and that its wider implications must be taken into account, Rajeev explains. “If they win, they can breathe a sigh of relief. But even if they do, this weekend will see demonstrations.”\\nSo even if this specific decision is overturned, the political damage is already done.\\n***\\nWhy is Labour on the back foot?\\nLabour came into office promising to “take back control” of the asylum system, a message aimed at reassuring voters worried about immigration and at blunting attacks from the right.\\nBy the government's own measures, it can point to results. The backlog of asylum applications has also fallen from its record highs, with ministers boasting that the rate of processing is up by 116% and that the UK has removed more people with no right to remain than at any point in the past five years. The government has also signed returns agreements with Iraq, Albania and Vietnam, and launched a pilot “one in, one out” scheme with France.\\n“It's tough on Home Office ministers who have made some progress over the last year, but then, like previous Home Office ministers, they just get terribly battered by events,” Rajeev says.\\n“It remains a mess and a huge headache for Yvette Cooper, who has been the chair of the home affairs select committee and shadow home secretary. She knows this job inside out. Angela Eagle is also a very experienced minister who understands how this works.\\n“Diana Johnson, who's the policing minister, also has a strong track record, as does Jess Phillips. They're all people who have a great record of actually getting things done and doing it well.”\\nBut by defining success so heavily in terms of enforcement and deterrence, Labour has aligned firmly with the right on immigration; leaving the party exposed if numbers rise again or critics demand tougher measures.\\n“They've really failed to launch any kind of narrative as to why refugees and asylum seekers bring something good to Britain,” says Rajeev.\\nBecause of that, the debate remains in Reform's preferred territory: a fight about who can be toughest on immigration, rather than a contest on Labour's own terms.\\nMihir Bose digs into the nuances of cultural symbolism in this fascinating opinion piece on what it means to be British.

But the judge said the home secretary's intervention was unnecessary and would merely use up court time.\\nSpeaking after Tuesday's ruling, the council's leader, Chris Whitbread, said: “I am delighted. This is great news for our residents. The last few weeks have placed an intolerable strain on our community but today we have some great news. This is not the end of the matter. Having obtained an interim provision, the next stage is for the council to return to the court and seek a permanent injunction.”\\nSince 2020, there has been greater reliance on hotels to house asylum seekers, with 32,345 being housed temporarily in England and Wales at the end of March this year. Labour has promised to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029 by cutting small boat crossings and building new government-owned accommodation.\\nEnver Solomon, the Refugee Council's chief executive, said: “The use of hotels is completely unsustainable – and this ruling shows that the government's plan to wait until 2029 to end their use is not viable.\\n“Through our frontline work we see how protests and hostility leave people who have fled war and persecution feeling terrified and targeted in the very places they are forced to live. This makes an already traumatising situation worse and robs people of any sense of safety.\\n“Instead of relying on costly hotels, the Home Office should partner with local councils to provide safe, cost-effective accommodation within communities. But to end hotel use for good, the government needs to think differently about how we can speed up and improve asylum decision-making.”\\nThe council said last week it was seeking the injunction due to “unprecedented levels of protest and disruption” in connection with asylum seeker accommodation. Whitbread had said the situation “cannot go on” but the government was not listening.\\nAt a hearing on Friday, barristers for the council said the site's “sole lawful use” was as a hotel and that Somani Hotels had breached planning rules by using it to house asylum seekers. Philip Coppel KC, for the authority, said the situation was “wholly unacceptable” and had provided a “feeding ground for unrest”.\\nHe said: “There has been what can be described as an increase in community tension, the catalyst of which has been the use of the Bell hotel to place asylum seekers. It is not the asylum seekers who are acting unlawfully. It is the defendant, by allowing the hotel to be used to house asylum seekers.” He added: “It really could not be much worse than this.”\\nOne council leader said he would gather “more detail about what Epping has done” before considering a bid to shut down another hotel thought to be housing asylum seekers.\\nCorina Gander, the Conservative leader of the borough of Broxbourne council, said crowds had gathered in protest outside the Cheshunt Marriott hotel in Hertfordshire, about six miles from the Bell hotel in Epping.\\nGander said the high court's decision had set a “massive precedent” and added: “It's just given us this massive boost and precedent that we can do something now.”\\nNigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, hailed the high court decision in Epping as a victory and said he hoped it “provides inspiration to others across the country”.\\nThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, suggested those housed at the hotel “need to be moved out of the area immediately”, while the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said “residents should never have had to fight their own government just to feel safe in their own town”.\"]"

         "[\"Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin as soon as next week to discuss the war in Ukraine, White House officials have said, although senior aides warned that serious “impediments” remain to achieving a ceasefire.\\nLate on Wednesday, the US president told reporters at the White House, when asked when he would meet the leaders of Ukraine and Russia: “There's a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.” Trump said there had been no specific breakthrough leading to talk of a meeting but that US officials had been working on it for “a long time”.\\nThe New York Times and CNN, citing people familiar with the plan, reported that Trump planned to sit down with Putin as early as next week, and then wanted a three-way meeting with the Russian president and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\nTrump gave no indication where a meeting with Putin might take place. It would be the first US-Russia leadership summit since Joe Biden met his counterpart in Geneva in June 2021.\\nWhite House officials briefed US media about a meeting with Putin after the US special envoy Steve Witkoff met the Russian leader at the Kremlin on Wednesday. After that meeting, Trump claimed “great progress was made” during the talks on ending the war in Ukraine.\\nTrump later told European leaders he was planning to meet Putin one-on-one as soon as next week and then follow up with a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the New York Times reported.\\nMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said he did not want to exaggerate the progress made during Witkoff's talks with Putin. “Hopefully if things continue to progress an opportunity will present itself for the president to meet with both Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy, hopefully in the near future,” Rubio told reporters. “But obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur.”\\nMany “impediments” to peace remained, he said, especially concerning territorial claims made by Russia, and there was no concrete proposal for a ceasefire on the table. “What we have is a better understanding of the conditions under which Russia would be willing to end the war,” he said. The US would then need to compare that with “what the Ukrainians are willing to accept”.\\nWitkoff's three-hour talks came two days before a deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war or face fresh sanctions.\\n“My special envoy, Steve Witkoff, just had a highly productive meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin,” Trump wrote on social media. “Great progress was made! Afterwards, I updated some of our European allies. Everyone agrees this war must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come.”\\nTrump gave no further details of what was discussed, and some analysts will be wary of reading too much into the comments, after previous claims by Trump that Putin was ready to negotiate resulted in little progress. Putin has given little indication he is ready to make concessions or willing to adjust Russia's core war aims.\\nHowever, there have been unconfirmed reports in recent days that the Kremlin could propose a halt to long-range strikes by both sides as an offer to Trump. It is not yet known if the possibility was discussed during Wednesday's Kremlin talks.\\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump called Zelenskyy, who was travelling back to Kyiv from a visit to frontline areas in the north-east of the country.\\n“Our joint position is very clear: the war has to end, and it has to be a just ending,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media afterwards. “European leaders also took part in the call and I am grateful to each of them for support. We discussed what had been said in Moscow. Ukraine has to defend its independence. We all need a long-lasting and reliable peace. Russia must finish the war that it started.”\\nTrump had promised to introduce secondary tariffs on countries that import Russian oil if no progress was made towards a peace deal by Friday. On Wednesday, he issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India's continuing imports of Russian oil.\\nIndia's external affairs ministry said it was “extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest”.\\nA senior administration official said further tariffs could come on Friday. “The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States. The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday,” said the official. \\nWitkoff arrived early on Wednesday and was pictured taking an early morning stroll through a park in central Moscow with Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin envoy who has played a key role in negotiations so far. Russian agencies reported that he left Russia early on Wednesday evening.\\nIt was Witkoff's fifth trip to Moscow in his capacity as Trump's lead negotiator with the Kremlin, but the first since Trump began taking a tougher line on Russia. Trump previously cut short an earlier 50-day deadline to Putin, claiming he saw no desire in the Kremlin to change its behaviour and calling recent strikes that killed civilians in Kyiv “disgusting”.\\nAfter Trump made the threat of further sanctions, the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev claimed the harsh rhetoric could lead to a direct conflict between Russia and the US. In response, Trump issued an order for two nuclear submarines to be repositioned.\\nTrump and Kyiv have been calling for a full and unconditional ceasefire to allow negotiations to begin, but even a pause in long-range strikes could offer welcome breathing space to both sides.\\nUkraine has hit Russian energy and military infrastructure with long-range drones, forcing airports to close. Meanwhile, Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities continue almost nightly.\\nOn some nights Russia sends up to 500 long-range kamikaze drones into Ukraine, and 72 people have been killed in Kyiv alone since May.\\nTrump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is expected to visit Kyiv in the coming days, although no firm date has been set.\", \"Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes summit on the Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.\\nDuring a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy's insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war.\\n“I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.”\\nEuropean diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions.\\nDescribing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both”. “We're going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added.\\nTrump, increasingly impatient with Putin in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person.\\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday's summit with Putin.\\nNeither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump's meeting with the Russian president.\\nTrump said on Monday that he would seek to arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian president has rejected so far.\\n“The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I'll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.\\nHe said a deal may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a “feel-out meeting”, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin proposed a “fair deal”. “I'll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,” he said.\\nMerz's office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.\\nIt is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.\\nEU foreign ministers were meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nEuropean leaders say Russia represents an existential threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process. Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia, any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting.\\nThere is concern that an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin, and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy.\\nThe Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear. \\nBrussels' top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But she added: “Any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.”\\nRadosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe's relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump's efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.”\\nThe White House is insisting that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy.\\nMerz spoke with Trump on Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the government.\\nA joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed: “The path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.”\\nPutin will go into Friday's talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against Russia.\\nLindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine's interests at the summit. He was involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump by Ukrainian officials.\\nHe said if Putin did not offer concessions, he expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price, adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India is already due to face 50% tariffs later this month.\\nSpeaking on NBC, Graham said: “Militarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.”\\nHe added: “I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.”\\nUkraine's leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.\\nEuropeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third countries, including some inside Nato.\", \"Good morning. Last night, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House flanked by a dream team of hastily assembled European heavyweights. Their aim: to coax Donald Trump out of pro-Russian positions he adopted after his Alaska meeting with Vladimir Putin last Friday.\\nThe meeting was a sign of both panic and resolve from Europe. The fact Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and more cleared their diaries at such short notice to fly to Washington is an indication of how alarmed they are by Trump's desire to move straight to a peace deal without a ceasefire – and his insistence that Zelenskyy give up Ukrainian territory.\\nProgress was made on US security guarantees, and Trump and Zelenskyy have said they will both be holding face-to-face talks with Putin – although the Russian and Ukrainian leaders still appear worlds apart in their demands. Macron said he had “serious doubts” about Putin's desire for peace.\\nFor this morning's newsletters, I had a chat with our senior international correspondent Luke Harding about the key points agreed in Washington last night, what it means for international diplomacy, and what is next for Ukraine. That's after the headlines.\\nTax | Rachel Reeves is considering replacing stamp duty with a new property tax that would apply to the sale of homes worth more than £500,000, the Guardian has been told.\\nUK news | Exposure to pornography has increased since the introduction of UK rules to protect the public online, with children as young as six seeing it by accident, research by the children's commissioner for England has found.\\nConservatives | Leaked WhatsApp messages show Conservative MPs are worried that their party's “piss-poor” messaging over asylum-seeker hotels is making the party look silly. It follows the release of an advert by Conservative campaign headquarters last week, making claims that have since been challenged as exaggerations, such as that asylum seekers receive free driving lessons and free PlayStation consoles.\\nBolivia | Bolivia's presidential election will go to a runoff, with two rightwing candidates seemingly the top runners. It's an unprecedented scenario after nearly two decades of leftist rule by the Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas).\\nEnvironment | Relentless heat and disastrous wildfires continue to ravage southern Europe, with one-quarter of weather stations in Spain recording 40C temperatures and above, the latest in a series of disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown amid a continental rollback of green policies.\\nThe aim of this rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force was to safeguard Ukraine, and Europe more broadly, from any widening aggression from Moscow. It was probably also a reminder to Trump of Europe's combined importance as an economic giant compared with Russia's much smaller economy.\\nThe European delegation included leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato. By arriving as a group they avoided another debacle like Zelenskyy's February visit to the Oval Office, where Trump and JD Vance chastised him as not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. Here is video of that meeting in case you'd like to remind yourself of the horrific blow-up that Trump thought was “great television”.\\n“The meeting with Zelenskyy and Trump was significantly better than their pretty awful encounter in February of this year,” says Luke Harding. “I think Zelenskyy was well prepared this time: he expressed gratitude to Trump on many occasions, handed a letter from his wife to Melania the first lady.” There was a fair amount of “sucking up to Donald Trump”, says Luke, and of European leaders not trying to offend him.\\nKey European demands are that all decisions must be made with Ukraine present, and that a ceasefire is a pre-condition before further peace talks. They were looking to understand what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement.\\nOverall, the atmosphere was good, says Luke. “Zelenskyy was even funny on occasions. When Brian Glenn – the reporter who mocked him for not wearing a suit in February – asked a question, Zelenskyy pointed out that Glenn was still wearing the same suit and Zelenskyy had changed his. So overall, the atmosphere was OK.”\\n***\\nDid they get through to Trump?\\nRather than concessions from Ukraine, the summit focused on arranging security guarantees in the event of a peace deal. Trump said the guarantees “would be provided by the various European countries [in] coordination with the United States of America”.\\nThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, described the development as “a breakthrough”. Membership of Nato is not on the table, but the US and European leaders are discussing “Article 5 kind of security guarantees for Ukraine”, Rutte said.\\n“What is important is that Trump said the US would play a role in providing security to Ukraine in the event of a settlement. You might consider that to be progress, but we don't know what it means,” says Luke. “As ever with Trump there is a huge gap between what he says and what he does.\\n“I suspect at the end of the day the White House will not want to do very much, but at least this was something tangible. The Kremlin appears to be quite annoyed – that is modest progress for Ukraine, depending on what the US is prepared to commit.”\\nTrump is still saying there is no need for a ceasefire – because he says he has stopped a number of wars without one. There appears to have been less movement on this issue. “The European position was that a ceasefire must come before any trilateral talks – that is common sense when Ukrainians are being killed every day,” says Luke.\\n***\\nHow did the meetings go for Zelenskyy?\\nLike Europe, Zelenskyy wants a ceasefire before any peace deal and is unwilling to make any territorial concessions. Kyiv wants Nato-like security guarantees sufficient to deter Russia from attacking again. As a reminder, Russia took Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and launched a full invasion in 2022, attacking four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.\\nAhead of the meeting, Trump had pushed Ukraine to give up Crimea and abandon its goal of joining Nato – both key demands made by Putin. But Zelenskyy stressed he had been able to present a clearer picture of the battle lines to Trump, whom he met in a one-on-one in the Oval Office.\\n“This was the best of our meetings,” Zelenskyy said, according to a statement put out by his office. “I was able to show many things, even on the map, to all American colleagues regarding the situation on the battlefield.”\\nLuke says: “On the substantive issue – which is how to get a peace deal – he correctly and deftly dodged a question on whether Ukraine was ready to swap land in return for peace.” This is Trump's preferred peace plan after his meeting with Putin in Alaska over the weekend.\\nSpeaking to reporters after the Washington talks, Zelenskyy said “we had a truly warm, good and substantial conversation”. The next steps in the negotiations turn back to Putin, and the Ukrainian president said he was ready for what would be their first face-to-face since Moscow's invasion nearly three and a half years ago. “I confirmed – and all European leaders supported me – that we are ready for a bilateral meeting with Putin.”\\n***\\nWhat did Trump get out of the meeting?\\nTrump previously bragged on numerous occasions that he could settle Russia's war in Ukraine in a day, but on Monday he said repeatedly that it was far more complicated than he ever thought it would be.\\nTrump previously favoured Kyiv's proposal for an immediate ceasefire to conduct deeper peace talks. However, he reversed course after the summit and indicated support for Russia's approach of negotiating a comprehensive deal while fighting continues (for a reminder of how bad things are on the ground in Ukraine, take a look at yesterday's newsletter).\\nAfter the Washington talks, Trump said on social media that he called Putin and began the arrangements for a meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, at a location to be determined. “This was a very good, early step for a war that has been going on for almost four years,” Trump said.\\nUkraine's president said he was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that territorial issues were “something we will leave between me and Putin”.\\n***\\nWhat next for the war in Ukraine and peace negotiations?\\nMuch remains unresolved, including red lines that are incompatible – like whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine's army, and whether the country will ultimately have lasting and meaningful security guarantees.\\n“I think where it will go from here,” says Luke, “is that when a deal fails to come together and Zelenskyy fails to give away his land, Trump will start blaming Zelenskyy again, saying he's the problem.\\n“Ultimately as things stand, there isn't really a meaningful way forward to a peace agreement. I mean Putin's demands are as maximalist as ever – he wants Ukraine to give up a large chunk in the east of the country, in the Donbas region.”\\nAlthough this seems to be Trump's preferred route to ending the conflict, it is unlikely to work for Zelenskyy – were he to make this huge concession, Luke says, he would be swept away by popular protest.\\n“I think it's entirely possible that in the next month or so, the Americans will comprehensively exit from supporting Ukraine. Already they've stopped delivering weapons. I can see a pull-out from Trump,” says Luke.\\n“What I find so strange is the way Trump defends Putin, wants to include him, talks about calling him imminently, says he had a great meeting in Alaska. It seems ultimately that is where his sympathies lie – with Russia.”\\nThe New York Times describes 64-year-old Betsy Lerner as a TikTok star, for the following she's amassed since she started reading out diary entries that she wrote in her twenties. In a new start after 60, Lerner explains she doesn't see herself that way. But a generation of 20-year-olds who find solace in her entries today may disagree.

         "[\"Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Johana Bhuiyan and Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who's enjoying the beach but likely getting sunburned.\\nTech companies are fighting to claim the title of having the world's most advanced AI. The goal is to supercharge their bottom line and keep investors and Wall Street happy. But developing the world's most advanced AI means spending billions on data centers and other physical infrastructure to house and power the supercomputers needed for AI. It also means a drain on natural resources and the grid in the areas surrounding data centers worldwide.\\nStill, last week's earnings reports made clear that tech firms are forging ahead. Google announced it was planning to spend $85bn on building out its AI and cloud infrastructure just in 2025 – $10bn more than it initially predicted. And the company expects that spending to increase again in 2026. For context, Google reported $94bn in revenue in the second quarter of this year. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said Google is in a “tight supply environment” when it comes to the infrastructure needed to support AI processing and compute. The results of this increased spending would still take years to be realized, he said.\\nGoogle isn't alone. Amazon has said it plans to spend $100bn in 2025 – the “vast majority” of which will go to powering the AI capabilities of its cloud division. As a point of comparison, Amazon spent just under $80bn in 2024.\\n“Sometimes people make the assumption that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component … that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology,” said Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy during an earnings call in February. “We've never seen that to be the case.”\\nMeta, too, has upped the amount it plans to spend on AI infrastructure. In June, Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on building out a network of massive data centers across the US including one that the firm expects to be up and running in 2026. Originally, executives said the firm was projected to spend $65bn in 2025 but adjusted that to anywhere between $64bn and $72bn.\\nMeta and Amazon report earnings this week.\\nArtificial intelligence companies have come under fire for cannibalizing creative industries. Artists have seen their work used without their permission as companies train their algorithms. Creative teams have shrunk and been laid off as parts of their work are being done by AI.\\n“It will mean that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today will easily, nearly instantly, and at almost no cost be handled by AI,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has said. “No problem.”\\nIn response, coalitions of artists have launched several copyright lawsuits against the top AI companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic. The companies say that under the “fair use” doctrine they should be able to use copyrighted material for free and without consent. Artists, including names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, say the companies shouldn't be able to profit off their work. So far, the AI companies are winning.\\nAdobe, the software company best known for making creative tools such as Photoshop, says it's trying to walk the line between developing useful AI programs and making sure artists aren't getting the short end of the stick.\\nThe company has introduced two “creator-safe” tools, that aim to tackle issues around copyright and intellectual property. One is its Firefly AI model, which Adobe says is trained only on licensed or public-domain content. The other is the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which lets photographers and other visual artists indicate when they don't want their work to be used to train AI and also lets them add credentials to their digital creations.\\nArtists can “apply a signature to it in the same way that a photographer might sign a photo or a sculptor would etch their initials into a sculpture”, said Andy Parsons, a senior director at Adobe who oversees the company's work on content authenticity. We spoke with Parsons about the burgeoning world of AI and what it means for creators.\\n***Q: What do you see as the biggest issues that creators and artists are facing with the advent of AI, and generative AI?\\nI think there's one prevailing issue, which is the concern that various AI techniques will compete with human ingenuity and with artists of all kinds. And that goes for agencies, publishers, individual creators.\\n***Q: Is Adobe Firefly one of the ways that Adobe is trying to address these problems and make sure that creators' work is not ripped off?\\nYeah, absolutely. From the beginning of Adobe Firefly, we followed two guiding principles. One is to make sure that Adobe Firefly is not trained on publicly available content. It's only trained on things that Adobe and the Firefly team have exclusive rights to use. That means that it can't do certain things. It cannot make a photo of a celebrity, because that celebrity's likeness we would consider guarded and potentially protected.\\nThe second thing we built in from the beginning is transparency, so knowing that something that comes out of Firefly was generated by AI. This is what we call content provenance, or content authenticity. It's making clear something is a photograph or made by an individual artist as opposed to made by AI.\\n***Q: What is the Adobe Firefly trained on?\\nIt's a combination of Adobe Stock and some licensed datasets. It's trained on things that Adobe has clear rights to use in this manner.\\n***Q: How do tech companies like Adobe avoid copyrighted materials sneaking into the datasets?\\nWe have licensed and clear rights to all of the data that goes into that dataset. There's an entire team devoted to trust, safety and assurances that the material is available to be used. We don't crawl the open web, because as soon as you do that, you do risk potentially infringing on someone's intellectual property. Our feeling is it's not always the case that more training data is better.\\n***Q: What does the future of human creativity look like now that we're living in this new world with generative AI?\\nWhen it comes to content authenticity, there's that “nutrition label” idea we sometimes talk about. If you walk into a food store, you have a fundamental right that's fulfilled in most democratic societies, to know what's in the food that you're going to serve your family. And we think the same is true of digital content. We have a fundamental right to know what it is.\\nLast week, the internet in the UK underwent a seismic change.

What could go wrong? I went to find out\", \"When the annals of 2025 at the movies are written, no one will remember The Electric State. The film, a sci-fi comic-book adaptation, is set in a world in which sentient robots have lost a war with humans. Netflix blew a reported $320m on it, making it the 14th most expensive film ever made. But it tanked: though The Electric State initially claimed the No 1 spot on the streamer, viewers quickly lost interest. Today, it doesn't even feature in the company's top 20 most viewed films, a shocking performance for its most expensive production to date. It became just another anonymous “mockbuster”, crammed with the overfamiliar, flashy signifiers of big-screen film-making: a Spielbergian childhood quest, a Mad Max post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fallout-style retro-futuristic trimmings.\\nAnother way of classifying The Electric State is as an example of the “algorithm movie”, the kind of generic product that clogs up streaming platforms and seems designed to appeal to the broadest audience possible. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, whose style might be politely described as “efficient”, specialise in this digital gruel; they also made the similarly forgettable action thriller The Gray Man, starring Ryan Gosling.\\nIf you haven't clicked on an algorithm movie, you've probably been offered one by autoplay. Often, the title obligingly lets you know what's in store: Tall Girl, a 2019 teenage romcom, is about a, well, tall girl; Uglies, a sub-Aldous Huxley sci-fi satire, is about a future in which cosmetic surgery is a rite of passage; in Murder Mystery, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play fish-out-of-water Yanks who turn Poirot on a European cruise. They may feature one of the new tier of stars, often big names but one level below those who are able to open films on their name alone, such as Tom Cruise or Margot Robbie. These actors – Sandler, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lopez, Gal Gadot – had the most to gain from kissing the streaming ring. The current king of the algorithm movie is Ryan Reynolds, who starred in 6 Underground, The Adam Project and Netflix's second most-viewed film, Red Notice.\\nAlgorithm movies usually exhibit easy-to-follow story beats that leave no viewer behind; under this regime, exposition is no longer a screenwriting faux pas. A recent n+1 article revealed that screenwriters who work with Netflix often receive the note: “Have this character announce what they're doing so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along.”\\nIn this age of “second-screen viewing”, the content remains within cosy aesthetic lines, so as not to jar viewers out of their Netflix'n'chill stupor. The lighting has that bright digital look, but remains stolidly low contrast. The sound mixes are flat because they need to work across environments and devices: people are watching on everything from VR headsets to beaten-up mobile phones.\\nAlgorithm-friendly entertainment – trawling as widely as possible for viewers, fully or half-attentive – is putting cinema on a slippery slope, believes Ted Hope, the one-time independent producer who went on to head up Amazon Original Movies in 2015. “If you see people are enjoying ambient programming, [the temptation is] to give them what they want. I would say: don't give them what they want.” Hope quit Amazon in 2020 as it was moving away from auteur-led titles (Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea, Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden) and towards a more populist strategy.\\nAmong the streaming companies, Netflix is by far the most successful. It now has 301 million subscribers worldwide – 100 million more than its nearest competitor, Amazon Prime Video. Releasing more than 100 film “originals” a year, it is more prolific than even the Hollywood studios in their Golden Age peak. It expanded in the 2010s from its US base into nearly 200 countries and operates as a monolithic global distributor of entertainment. While some of its content is purely local, it also aims to select the most promising titles throughout the world and make them available internationally (as happened with the TV show Squid Game and the 2022 Oscar-winning German adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front).\\nNetflix's model, and its enormous success, gives it unprecedented influence over cinema's future. It's unclear how far the shape of that influence is determined by the algorithm. Certainly any Netflix viewer will have noticed the proliferation of films that seem to fit the category of “algorithm movie” – but they are not algorithmic in the sense of being directly machine-generated (at least not yet). The company's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, has denied “reverse-engineering” films from its data, telling Vulture.com in 2018 commissioning was “70% gut and 30% data” (though in an interview three years earlier, he had it the other way around). Netflix's PR department declined to let me talk to any of its senior executives for this story, but it reiterated the line about “the misconception that we commission by algorithm”. A number of the company's former executives, and others in the film industry, would only speak to me on condition of anonymity; aware of Netflix's current dominant position in the industry, and its caginess about its use of data, they fear it could harm their careers if they spoke publicly about their experiences.\\nSo what is going on inside the black boxes of the streaming platforms? To what extent are algorithms and data really driving film production – and if they aren't, where are all the so-called algorithm movies coming from?\\nIn the late 00s, Netflix's then director of personalisation, Todd Yellin, set himself a trifling task: completely redefining the taxonomy of how films and TV were classified. He was a dedicated cinephile and director who had made a well-received debut feature in 2006, the Brooklyn family drama Brother's Shadow. But working at Netflix gave him an opportunity to flex other skills. “I also have a mathematical side to my brain,” he said, “so I thought if you subdivide movies and TV shows into their constituent parts and tagged them accordingly, would that help put the right title in front of the right person at the right time?”\\nThis was his plan for refining Netflix's recommendation system; the process by which content is sorted and mathematically weighted in order to give individual users the most pleasing selection. Often referred to as “the algorithm”, it actually involves 10 or more interlocking ones.\\nAfter putting his toddlers to bed, Yellin would sit down in an old chair and raid his library of cinema books for ideas about how to classify content. He quickly went beyond the repertoire of traditional genres – horror, comedy, thriller – to begin tagging titles by subject-related criteria: “Is it about dancing? Architecture? Marital relationships? Then we'd look at emotions – how dark is it?” For tonal matters, he and his team assigned values from one to five or one to 10.\\nA new job position – “tagger”– was created to watch and classify Netflix content. Yellin remembers it as painstaking work. He and his helpers eventually devised what in 2014 amounted to 77,000 “altgenres” (there are very likely more now): the categorisations that also, depending on what the algorithm serves you, appear on the Netflix homepage as row labels, the categories of films you're offered. They run from the blandly familiar (“Adventure films”) to the slightly more specific (“Relentless crime thrillers”) to the infuriatingly broad (“Feel all the feels”). And then of course there's the “Casual viewing” supposedly rotting everyone's brains, the likes of The Electric State or Red Notice, an action-comedy that's a mashup of James Bond, Indiana Jones and Fast & Furious.\\nSometimes these row labels are automatically generated, based on underlying relationships between the altgenres revealed by machine learning. Every user is assigned a mathematical “distance” to each altgenre, based on how much or how little they interact with them on the platform. Aggregated across millions of users, this web of consumption patterns reveals unexpected correspondences, overlaps and affinities in viewers' tastes. One example was the overlap between audiences who liked Formula One and classic rock'n'roll documentaries; in that instance, the recommendation system might generate a category that combined the two.\\nThis deeper data architecture was a gamechanger for Netflix. Originally, the service had generated recommendations based on a five-star system of user ratings, but in 2017 Netflix abandoned this in favour of the altgenre-based system. “Moving from explicit to implicit recommendations was the big shift,” said Yellin. “Recommendations based on behaviour – what you actually watched and consumed, versus what you said you liked.”\\nThe streaming companies receive, through their user interfaces, unprecedented amounts of data. In 2017, Netflix logged 700bn “data events” – interactions with the platform in some form – per day. Not just whether you opted for something in “So completely captivating” or a sports documentary – but what device you watched it on, what time of day you were viewing, how many other titles you lingered over, whether you turned something off early, how many times you rewatched, and on and on. All nodes in the galactic data cloud the services use to decide what films and TV shows to put in front of us.\\nIt's not surprising that data culture is embedded in the way streaming services do business. After all, they were tech companies long before they were film studios. Amazon Prime Video is of course an off-shoot of the world's largest online retailer, while Netflix – which started as a mail-by-DVD business in 1997 – was similarly rooted in online logistics. Its co-founder Reed Hastings was originally a computer scientist and engineer. But as Netflix matured from a distribution company into a studio – producing its first TV show, House of Cards, in 2013, and its first film, the African war drama Beasts of No Nation in 2015 – the importance of data in creative decision-making has only grown.\\nLike most Silicon Valley outfits, Netflix likes to move fast. Within five seconds, to be precise – this, according to the pitch workshop document they hand out to potential collaborators, is the length of time within which the “audience subconsciously decides whether they will watch your show”.\\nA swift and unambiguous opening is a non-negotiable for the company; most of the film-makers interviewed for this article mentioned it. Screenwriter Aron Coleite was brought on to punch up the 2024 sci-fi film Atlas. His draft originally opened with the film's star, Jennifer Lopez, interrogating the severed head of a robot terrorist. It was deemed too left-field and Coleite ended up replacing it with a more conventional Swat team raid intro; he was swayed by Netflix's data demonstrating that viewers need to be hooked within a certain window. He feels that window is getting shorter: “I see it shrinking as attention spans are harder to corral.”\\nAt Netflix, specialist strategy and analysis teams are embedded within every division of the business. The strategy and analysis team in the content division helps value a prospective new title – whether acquired or developed in-house – by modelling its performance based on historical data. The company has been doing this a long time: there are talks available on YouTube going as far back as 2016, in which Caitlin Smallwood, then head of science and algorithms at Netflix, details how a film's predicted success evolved according to new elements added during pre-production, such as certain actors coming on board, or the reaction on social media to a teaser trailer. (Netflix later clamped down on this kind of disclosure, afraid it might be interpreted as the algorithmic adulteration of art.)\\nAccording to Smallwood, this process went as far as assessing pitch decks or scripts for elements that might boost or reduce their appeal. Director Cary Fukunaga mentioned a complex narrative structure in his 2018 big pharma miniseries Maniac being nixed because of the audience loss predicted by the data. “The algorithm's argument is gonna win at the end of the day,” he told GQ. Netflix's data teams were always developing new products to guide content-related decisions, including software that displayed important statistics (such as the relevant altgenres and other classifications) for every title in baseball card-style summaries, and a tool that rated the audience appeal of niche character actors.\\nSmallwood, who left Netflix in 2021, said that nothing was enforced on the basis of data alone. “With content executives, our team's goal was to enhance the creative process – not to replace it. We wanted them to consider what the data and algorithms suggested, even if they rejected it,” she said. When I talked to creatives, it was striking that persuasion rather than coercion seemed to be Netflix's modus operandi. Almost all the people working with streaming companies I spoke to said they were surprised by how little raw data they were given. During the making of films in particular, the note-giving process remained largely as it has always been, rooted in executive intuition.\\nThe company does issue house style guides, very probably influenced by data at some level. Some of these guides are narrative-related, like the pitch workshop one, which has a pretty generic set of screenwriting rules, like “Who is the hero, and what do they want?” and “The location should be a character in your story”. (Nothing so egregious as insisting characters announce what they're doing.) Sometimes these address aesthetic matters: a producer who has worked on one of the company's recent hit shows mentions a stipulation to ape the chilly David Fincher look. Yellow is apparently a resonant, usefully non-gendered colour when conceiving children's programmes, following in the Day-Glo wake of SpongeBob and the Minions.\\nThe most tangible data film-makers receive comes in the form of periodic performance reviews – three, 10, 30 days after release – practised by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Often this consists of figures on viewership and completion rates; some people find this nebulous compared to box office revenue, the performance metric traditionally used by studios. There's also Netflix Preview Club which, unlike the performance reviews, allows pre-release tweaks to be made. The Preview Club is an early-access section for invited viewers, and combines up-to-date monitoring of how viewers interact with a piece of entertainment with more traditional focus group-type questioning. But it's not clear how much of this research film-makers themselves are privy to. Several tell me that it would have been helpful, as they made final post-production changes, to have had more granular data on audience reactions.\\nOften, what film-makers and executives told me about the streamers' approach to data didn't sound so different from the old Hollywood studio production-line mentality. Studios have always sought a rationalised and repeatable formula for success, from the typecasting of actors during the Golden Age to proscriptive screenwriting manuals like Syd Field's Screenplay and Blake Snyder's Save the Cat during the conglomerate era, and rigorous test screening. Script analysis software in the 2000s, like Epagogix and ScriptBook, tried to predict box office success based on story tropes and the personnel attached to projects; these were prototypic versions of what the streaming companies are doing now. If algorithms are a fixed set of steps leading to a controllable outcome, then the earlier development process, trying to line up the ducks of storytelling in the right order, was also algorithmic in a crude sense.\\nIn fact, more data has just intensified old-school Hollywood problems, such as how to get film-makers, and even the streaming companies' own creative executives, to trust it to guide artistic matters. Part of the problem is agreeing how to usefully interpret the swirl of data. The different metrics, and the importance assigned to them, changed constantly, said a former Netflix film executive. “I had more managers than I could count, and the success metrics changed just as often. You can have all the metrics you want but that does not mean you are making better decisions or creating more loved content.” Executives can also selectively interpret data to stack the deck in favour of their own projects, said a producer who has overseen a slate of films for Netflix. In its external PR, the company advertises the uniqueness and sophistication of its algorithm; internally, however, people are still trying to realise their own preferences and passions. “And they leverage the algorithm for that,” the producer said.\\nAnd film-makers and executives alike know the truth: when it comes to assessing the probable success of a title, data can only do so much. Netflix is diligent about predicting how titles will perform on the platform, regularly reviewing the accuracy of its forecasts and subsequently updating the models. But many major hits, such as The Queen's Gambit and Squid Game, were a complete surprise. William Goldman's famous maxim about Hollywood – “Nobody knows anything” – still holds.\\nBut if Netflix doesn't burden film-makers with data, and if there's no consensus about how to interpret what little data they do see, then what's responsible for all the familiar-feeling, paint-by-numbers content that's crowding your screen?\\nOne answer is that the data is in fact making decisions, just at an earlier stage in the process: it determines what does and doesn't get commissioned. Film-makers are unlikely to be aware whether their project was greenlit or turned down on the basis of what data or algorithms said about it. But I spoke to one agent who told me that, at one major studio, creative executives have been excluded from the greenlighting committee so as not to skew the decision-making process with old-fashioned artistic frippery.\\nOthers in the industry have different explanations for the glut of algorithm movies. Producer Neal Dodson, whose 2019 thriller Triple Frontier was a Netflix Original, thinks that executives aren't paying too much attention to the swirl and confusion of data; they're merely choosing to play it safe. “They wanna make great movies, but they don't wanna get fired,” Dodson said. “They're afraid if they do something a little too risky, they'll get fired. But if they don't do anything risky enough, people say they didn't make good movies. It's a rock and a hard place.” Maybe this conservatism – hardly unusual for Hollywood executives – is what has fuelled the algorithm movie, rather than anything truly algorithmic.\\nThere's a certain irony to still being beholden to the restricted thinking of the analogue era, said another former Netflix film executive: “I used to joke that, because of the acceleration of everything, Netflix had gone from being a very new media company to quite an old-fashioned media company quicker than ever before.”\\nAnother reason for tired, samey content could be the lack of oversight that characterised Netflix's growth phase in the late 2010s. Before that, it had supported auteurs who were struggling to get backing from Hollywood studios; this brought the company the likes of Bong Joon-ho's eco-terrorism action-adventure Okja, Alfonso Cuarón's memoir-drama Roma, and Martin Scorsese's long-gestating crime epic The Irishman.\\nBut around 2016, Netflix decided to change its approach. It flooded the platform with content, bankrolled by issuing debt (up from around $500m in 2013 to nearly $13bn in 2019). It scrabbled to deliver enough movies and TV shows to its expanding subscriber base; South Park ribbed the company in one episode, by having its executives answer the phone: “Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?”\\nA producer of an independent movie, who received more than $10m in funding from Netflix, said he was given no notes during shooting, and the company's executives did not watch the dailies. “They basically wired us the money; my impression was I shouldn't call them unless there was a house on fire. They have more money than any studio ever maybe, but they couldn't stay on top of all their films. You can't scale that quickly.” Many other film-makers I spoke to similarly claimed that Netflix largely gave them a free hand.\\nThis producer believes the lack of rigour and the lack of experienced film executives during the company's expansion phase hurt its quality control. On the one hand, this phase allowed the creation of left-field or brilliant works like Okja, the erratic art-world satire Velvet Buzzsaw, and Charlie Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things. On the other, it allowed reams of landfill titles with generic plots and shooting styles to pile up on the platform.\\nNetflix's expansion era came to a sudden end in spring 2022. The explosive, pandemic-driven subscriber growth of 2020 – when Netflix added 37 million new members – had petered out, and in the last quarter of 2021 and the first of 2022, it lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Wall Street responded: the company's share price dropped 57% on a single day.\\nThis caused a crisis of confidence within Netflix. The company capped its content budget at $17bn a year, ending the precipitous annual rises of the previous few years. The blank-cheque policy for big-name directors was also cancelled (romcom queen Nancy Meyers' $150m-budgeted comeback Paris Paramount was scrapped, for example).\\nAfter Netflix introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier in 2022 and clamped down on password sharing the following year, subscriber numbers started climbing again. But the company is still trying to run a tighter ship. It appointed the seasoned Warner Bros executive Dan Lin as its new head of film in February 2024; according to the Hollywood Reporter, he got the job on the basis of telling the company “the movies were not great and the financials didn't add up”. It's too early in his tenure to judge him on his film output, but the expectation is that he will clamp down on quantity and budgets, while trying to bolster quality.\\nThis approach is compatible with what Bela Bajaria, Netflix's chief content officer, called the company's “gourmet cheeseburger” model – offering viewers familiar-feeling, mass-market products with upmarket production values. Spread-betting on an inoffensive mainstream, rather than riskily hunting down artistic excellence, is better for sustaining subscriber numbers. People might be drawn to a platform by a single standout title, but they remain on it when they know there will be a steady supply of good-enough titles.\\nAs Steven Soderbergh told Vulture: “The entire industry has moved from a world of Newtonian economics into a world of quantum economics, where two things that seem to be in opposition can be true at the same time: you can have a massive hit on your platform, but it's not actually doing anything to increase your platform's revenue.” A film's success is no longer solely defined by its box office performance; stuck inside a single streaming platform, it has been walled off from hard financial realities. Netflix's slippery viewing metrics have encouraged this disconnect. It used to define a “view” as watching 70% of a movie. In January 2020, the company decided that watching two minutes was enough to qualify. Now, it calculates the number of views for a film or TV show by the total number of viewing hours logged by all users for a title, divided by its run time (so as not to disadvantage shorter titles); better, but still a smeary average.\\nCertain film-makers – like David Fincher, who is contracted to Netflix – see artistic liberty in throwing off the shackles of the box office. Others see this new lack of accountability as drifting ever further towards algorithmic blandness. “The best thing you can do if your business goal is limited to audience acquisition is to get everybody to watch the same thing,” said Ted Hope. “Because even if you have that strategy of a regular cadence of supply, you know that what increases engagement is more people talking about the same thing.”\\nThere was once a notion that streaming companies – facilitated by infinite server space and bottomless catalogues – would find new audiences for more obscure film titles. But in an analysis of Netflix viewing data between 2016 and 2019, independent researcher Stephen Follows found that the company was even more reliant on a handful of big titles than theatrical box office: the top 7% of Netflix titles in the US accounted for 50% of views (compared to 41% of box-office takings for the top 7% of cinema titles).\\nIt isn't so much that movies are being made by algorithm as that, by continually surfacing the mass-market or safe choice, the algorithm itself has a flattening, coarsening effect on our overall tastes. It's intriguing that while the majority of Netflix collaborators interviewed for this piece praised their individual creative experience, most also expressed concern about how algorithms may be homogenising culture on a wider scale. “It is a fear of mine,” said the director of a major Netflix blockbuster. “There's this constant balance that we're trying to find with technology. Algorithms can be incredibly useful when you want a suggestion for what to watch. And they can also be madly infuriating and the stifler of originality and creativity. Both can be true.”\\nNetflix, or at least some of its former employees, are aware of the issue. Smallwood said that her greatest challenge was how to lead viewers into the deeper catalogue and avoid offering them only variations on what they've already watched. “We intentionally injected variety into people's personalised pages,” she said. “As if we're sprinkling in a few items that are not at the very top of the algorithm's list.” (The company has recently filed patents for innovations to this effect.) It even experimented with different ways that viewers could express their preferences in order to shape what they're shown. But “consumers don't want to have to work hard to find what to watch,” said Smallwood. “They just want the right thing served up to them.”\\nNot only do streaming companies have no incentive to promote diversity of content in the industry, said Ted Hope, but they have also destroyed the broader business model that makes diversity possible. When Netflix or another streaming service buys a film, it effectively demands that it becomes the single distributor worldwide; this model innately favours mass-market work that will travel widely. It has also rendered obsolete the old piecemeal tactic of pre-selling distribution rights in individual territories, which was often how independent films cobbled together their budgets.\\nThe trade analyst Tansy Kelly Robson pointed out that before the streaming era, even the traditional studios were incentivised to take on some more offbeat films. Though such titles had uncertain box office value, studios could generate revenue from them by reselling them to TV networks. But with the streaming companies' films corralled inside their own platforms, the newcomers have little reason to make adventurous work with value elsewhere. If they need to shake up their catalogue, they can cherrypick maverick indie work that performed well in cinemas or at festivals – without taking on the financial risk of developing them.\\nRobson noted that a prominent film might bring subscribers to a platform, “but it's hard to tell if that's [because of] the show or another extraneous factor, and cost per viewer makes it, essentially, a loss-leader”. That is quite possibly the case not only for more unusual offerings, but also for expensive algorithm movie misses like The Electric State. But it seems that what Netflix is doing is working – and that Wall Street is convinced for now. Since April 2022, its stock prices have steadily risen. Customers and shareholders seem happy enough with the platform's never-ending carousel of forgettable offerings.\\nNetflix may be back on track, but the algorithm movie as we know it is about to be super-charged by the next generation of automation: AI. The technology, by its nature, plunders the creativity of the past. For the film industry's purposes, its training data will include scripts, footage, soundtracks, editing patterns, special effects work, every conceivable domain of labour from Hollywood's last 125 years. Auto-generating all of these using AI will cost a fraction of doing them for real. But the gains in productivity and efficiency will come at the cost of further entrenching the algorithmic approach to creativity.\\nAI is already being used on the fringes of films. Netflix used generative AI to insert CGI characters into some shots in The Electric State and also to create a sequence of a collapsing building in the Argentinian sci-fi series El Eternauta. Amazon also used the technology for visual effects work in its biblical series House of David. But such examples are far from generating a film or TV series from scratch.\\nTodd Yellin believes ChatGPT is capable of writing a cookie-cutter Christmas movie now – but the potential blowback for trampling on human artistry wouldn't be worth the risk. Most interviewees I canvassed think we are still some years away from AI producing a boundary-pushing script.\\nThe streaming firms already auto-generate artwork and trailers, personalised for each subscriber. If, say, Good Will Hunting appears on the feed of an inveterate romcom watcher, their thumbnail image for the film would feature Matt Damon and Minnie Driver getting cosy; for a user who prefers comedies, Robin Williams would feature. For Yellin, this kind of use of AI remains on the right side of the line: “An important distinction artistically and perhaps ethically is between using algorithms and generative AI to create a movie or TV show versus using them to create a promotional piece of content.”\\nBut it's hard to believe that the streamers will stop there. Stephen Follows recently conducted a survey of patents being filed by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video; among the former's 500 filings are machine learning-based tools for editing and visual effects, while the latter has filed more than 7,000 patents in similar areas. Its innovations span every area from script analysis, to automated storyboarding, to synthetic audience simulation in which to test key concepts, to “emotion monitoring” that can track viewer responses in real time.\\nThe strange paradox of the streaming era is that as the quest to personalise entertainment has continued, entertainment itself is becoming steadily more impersonal. The user, and the fantasy of unlimited choice, is king. The auteur, and singularity of perspective, are now subordinate – and the tsunami of AI threatens to wash them away completely.\\nYellin is still trying to reconcile the industry's turn to optimised content with his passion for art that has personality. He quit Netflix at the end of 2022 to return to his first love, directing. He co-wrote and directed The 52nd State, a crime story about a Costa Rican IT worker laid off by Hewlett-Packard who gets embroiled in a scam. It finally started shooting this summer. But, returning to a radically altered film-making landscape, Yellin was taken aback at how difficult it now is to raise financing for an indie. “It's been a hard road. The model for making an independent film has shifted,” he admitted. “Many companies have stepped away from pre-financing independent films. Why put up the risk to fund them ahead of time, when they can pick the ones they want out of the litter later?”\\nWhy indeed? Luckily, he still had his connections, and his old friend, the Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, stepped in to bolster the project as executive producer; his first foray into film production. The billionaire tech mogul brings in the cavalry for beleaguered indie film: how's that for an algorithmically neat third-act plot twist? \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\\n• This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to correct Park Chan-wook's name.\", \"If you have a mental image of a Nobel prizewinner, Demis Hassabis probably doesn't fit it. Relatively young (he's 49), mixed race (his father is Greek-Cypriot, his mother Chinese-Singaporean), state-educated, he didn't exactly look out of place receiving his medal from the king of Sweden in December, amid a sea of grey-haired men, but it was “very surreal”, he admits. “I'm really bad at enjoying the moment. I've won prizes in the past, and I'm always thinking , ‘What's the next thing?' But this one was really special. It's something you dream about as a kid.”\\nWell, maybe not you, but certainly him. Hassabis was marked out as exceptional from a young age – he was a chess prodigy when he was four. Today, arguably, he's one of the most important people in the world. As head of Google DeepMind, the tech giant's artificial intelligence arm, he's driving, if not necessarily steering, what promises to be the most significant technological revolution of our lifetimes.\\nAs such, Hassabis finds himself in the position of being both a booster for AI and an apologist for it. The Nobel prize in chemistry was proof of the benefits AI can bring: DeepMind's AlphaFold database was able to predict the hitherto-unfathomable structures of proteins, the building blocks of life – a breakthrough that could lead to myriad medical advances. At the same time, fears are ever growing about the AI future that Google is helping to usher in.\\nBeing an AI ambassador is the part Hassabis didn't dream about. “If I'd had my way, we would have left it in the lab for longer and done more things like AlphaFold, maybe cured cancer or something like that,” he says. “But it is what it is, and there's some benefits to that. It's great that everyone gets to play around with the latest AI and feel for themselves what it's like. That's useful for society, actually, to kind of normalise it and adapt to it, and for governments to be discussing it … I guess I have to speak up on, especially, the scientific side of how we should approach this, and think about the unknowns and how we can make them less unknown.”\\nIn person Hassabis is a mix of down-to-earth approachability and polished professionalism. Trim and well groomed, dressed entirely in black, he wears two watches: one a smart watch, the other an analogue dress watch (smart but not too flashy). He gives the impression of someone in a hurry. We're speaking in his office at DeepMind's London headquarters. On the walls outside are signed chess boards from greats such as Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Judit Polgár. He still plays; there's a board set up on a table nearby.\\nIt was the chess that started Hassabis down the path of thinking about thinking. Between the ages of four and 13 he played competitively in England junior teams. “When you do that at such a young age, it's very formative for the way your brain works. A lot of the way I think is influenced by strategic thinking from chess, and dealing with pressure.”\\nOn paper there's little else about Hassabis's background that foretold his future. His family are more on the arty side: “My dad's just finished composing a musical play in his retirement, which he staged at an arthouse theatre in north London. My sister's a composer, so I'm kind of the outlier of the family.” They weren't poor, but not super-wealthy. He moved between various state schools in north London, and was homeschooled for a few years.\\nHe was also a bit of an outsider at school, he says, but he seems to have known exactly where he was going. His childhood heroes were scientific pioneers such as Alan Turing and Richard Feynman. He spent his chess winnings on early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and a Commodore Amiga, and learned to code. “There were few people that were interested in computers in the late 80s. There was a group of us that used to hack around, making games and other stuff, and then that became my next career after chess.”\\nIn the 90s, the games industry was already working with AI. When he was 17, he coded the hit game Theme Park, in which players had to build a virtual amusement park. “The game reacted to how you were playing it,” he says. Put a food stall too close to the rollercoaster exit and your virtual punters would start throwing up.\\nAfter studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, then a PhD at University College London in neuroscience, he set up DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg, a fellow postdoctoral neuroscientist, and Mustafa Suleyman, a former schoolmate and a friend of his younger brother. The mission was straightforward, Hassabis says: “Solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.”\\nDeepMind soon caught Silicon Valley's attention. In 2014 the team showed off an AI that learned to master Atari video games such as Breakout, without any prior knowledge. Interest started to come from now-familiar tech players, including Peter Thiel (who was an early DeepMind investor), Google, Facebook and Elon Musk. Hassabis first met Musk in 2012. Over lunch at Space X's factory in California, Musk told Hassabis his priority was getting to Mars “as a backup planet, in case something went wrong here. I don't think he'd thought much about AI at that point.” Hassabis pointed out the flaw in his plan. “I said, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn't help you, because if we got there, it would obviously be easy for an AI to get there, through our communication systems or whatever it was.' He just hadn't thought about that. So he sat there for a minute without saying anything, just sort of thinking, ‘Hmm, that's probably true.'”\\nShortly after, Musk, too, became an investor in DeepMind.\\nIn 2014, Google bought the company for £400m (as a result, Musk and Thiel switched to backing the rival startup OpenAI). It wasn't just access to cash and hardware that convinced them to go with Google. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer scientists like him, and “saw Google as ultimately an AI company”, says Hassabis. He also used products such as Gmail and Maps. “And finally, I just thought that the mission of Google, which is to organise the world's information, is a cool mission.”\\nFrom his office window, we can see the vast beige bulk of Google's just-about-finished new office, where DeepMind will be moving next year. It's fair to say the reason the tech giant is putting so much into Britain is because of Hassabis, who insisted on staying in London. “Our first backers were like, ‘You've got to move to San Francisco,' but I wanted to prove it was possible here,” he says. “I knew there was untapped talent around. And I knew, if we were successful, how important [AI] would be for the world, so I felt it was important to have a global approach to it, and, not just, you know, 100 square miles of Silicon Valley. I still believe that's important.”\\nIn 2016, DeepMind again caught the tech world's attention when its AI defeated one of the world's best players of Go – a board game considerably more complex than chess. The AlphaFold breakthrough on protein structures was another leap forward: DeepMind has now solved the structures of over 200m proteins and made the resource publicly available.\\nBut the AI landscape shifted seismically in 2022 with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which captured the public imagination with its uncanny ability to tackle a host of problems – from strategy planning to writing poetry. ChatGPT caught big tech off guard, especially Google. “They really went for scaling, almost in a bet-the-house sort of way, which is impressive, and maybe you have to do that as a startup,” says Hassabis. “We all had systems that are very similar, the leading labs, but we could see the flaws in it, like it would hallucinate sometimes. I don't think anyone fully understood, including OpenAI, that there would be these amazing use cases for it, and people would get a lot of value out of them. So that's an interesting lesson for us about how you can be a bit too close to your own technology.”\\nThe race is now on. DeepMind has become “the engine room of Google”, as Hassabis puts it, and AI is being built into every corner of its business: AI search summaries; smart assistant Gemini (Google's answer to ChatGPT); an AI image generator (that can add in sound effects); AI-powered smart glasses, translation tools, shopping assistants. How much the public really craves this AI-enhanced world remains to be seen. Competitors are also raising their game. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others are investing heavily, and poaching talent from their rivals. Zuckerberg is offering $100m salaries for top researchers. Suleyman, who left DeepMind in 2019, is now head of Microsoft AI, which recently poached more than 20 engineers from DeepMind. He hesitates to call his former friend a rival: “We do very different things. I think he's more on the commercial applied side; we're still focused more on that frontier research side.”\\nThat frontier to be reached is surely AGI – “artificial general intelligence” – the pivotal point at which AI matches human intelligence. “I don't know if it will be a single moment. It may be a gradual thing that happens,” he says, “but we'll have something that we could sort of reasonably call AGI, that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 years, possibly the lower end of that.”\\nIn other words, we are in the final few years of pre-AGI civilisation, after which nothing may ever be the same again. To some the prospect is apocalyptic, to others, like Hassabis, it's utopian.\\n“Assuming we steward it safely and responsibly into the world, and obviously we're trying to play our part in that, then we should be in a world of what I sometimes call radical abundance,” says Hassabis. He paints a picture of medical advances, room-temperature superconductors, nuclear fusion, advances in materials, mathematics. “It should lead to incredible productivity and therefore prosperity for society. Of course, we've got to make sure it gets distributed fairly, but that's more of a political question. And if it is, we should be in an amazing world of abundance for maybe the first time in human history, where things don't have to be zero sum. And if that works, we should be travelling to the stars, really.”\\nIs he getting too close to his own technology? There are so many issues around AI, it's difficult to know where to even begin: deepfakes and misinformation; replacement of human jobs; vast energy consumption; use of copyright material, or simply AI deciding that we humans are expendable and taking matters into its own hands.\\nTo pick one issue, the amount of water and electricity that future AI datacentres are predicted to require is astronomical, especially when the world is facing drought and a climate crisis. By the time AI cracks nuclear fusion, we may not have a planet left. “There's lots of ways of fixing that,” Hassabis replies. “Yes, the energy required is going to be a lot for AI systems, but the amount we're going to get back, even just narrowly for climate [solutions] from these models, it's going to far outweigh the energy costs.”\\nThere's also the worry that “radical abundance” is another way of framing “mass unemployment”: AI is already replacing human jobs. When we “never need to work again” – as many have promised – doesn't that really mean we're surrendering our economic power to whoever controls the AI? “That's going to be one of the biggest things we're gonna have to figure out,” he acknowledges. “Let's say we get radical abundance, and we distribute that in a good way, what happens next?”\\nHassabis has two sons in their late teens (his Italian-born wife is a molecular biologist). What does he envisage for their future? “It's a bit like the era I was growing up in, where home computers were coming online. Obviously it's going to be bigger than that, but you've got to embrace the new technology ... If you become an expert, kind of a ninja, at using these things, it's going to really empower the people that are good at these tools.”\\nNon-ninjas will still have a place, however: “We need some great philosophers, but also economists to think about what the world should look like when something like this comes along. What is purpose? What is meaning?” He points out that there are many things we do that aren't strictly for utility: sports, meditation, arts. “We're going to lean into those areas, as a society, even more heavily, because we'll have the time and the resources to do so.”\\nIt's difficult to see Hassabis himself carving out much of that time, between DeepMind, his drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs and his endless public appearances – the list goes on. “I don't have much time that isn't working, seven days a week,” he acknowledges. “I spend time with my kids playing games, board games, and that's some of my most fun times.” He doesn't let them win, he says. “We play very competitively.”\\nHe's also a season ticket holder at Liverpool FC and makes it to “six, seven games a year”. He still plays chess online – “It's a bit like going to the gym, for the mind.” And he's a mean poker player, apparently. The night after winning his Nobel prize he celebrated with a poker night with Magnus Carlsen and some world poker champions. “In another universe, I might have been a professional gamer.”\\nSo, no fears about the future? “I'm a cautious optimist,” he says. “So overall, if we're given the time, I believe in human ingenuity. I think we'll get this right. I think also, humans are infinitely adaptable. I mean, look where we are today. Our brains were evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and we're in modern civilisation. The difference here is, it's going to be 10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.” The Industrial Revolution was not plain sailing for everyone, he admits, “but we wouldn't wish it hadn't happened. Obviously, we should try to minimise that disruption, but there is going to be change – hopefully for the better.”\\n• This article was amended on 4 August 2025 because an earlier version said OpenAI's “ChatGPT3” was released in 2020; that meant to refer to ChatGPT, which was released in 2022.

Even fewer are scrutinising how those authoritarian leaders are trying to misdirect public attention away from the root cause of our current global malaise.\\nThe Guardian is different.\\nAbout nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take stronger climate actions, yet we've witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster.\\nPowerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises and some are funding secretive lobby groups and far-right politicians that want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change.\\nThe pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world's biggest fossil fuel producer appears intent on undermining hard-won progress on reducing emissions.\\nThe most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US National Weather Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding.\\nThen there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain.\\nMost alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their doomsday bunkers.\\nThere also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible.\\nThe Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.\\nWorse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change.\\nThe Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both.\\nEarlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European politicians since at least February 2023.\\nIn these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian's earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action.\\nWe are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us.

Tiny fragments – invisible to the human eye – are probably swimming around your lungs, blood and liver right now.\\nThis represents a “growing and underrecognised danger” to human health, the latest report in the Lancet warns, as 10 days of tense talks kick off in Geneva today, with 179 countries due to hash out a kind of “Paris agreement for plastic pollution”.\\nThese talks – which have been going on since 2022 – have been dogged by deep disagreements. More than 100 nations want a legally binding cap on plastic production, while petrostates want to keep things vague, and maybe promise to, errrrr, do some more recycling, perhaps? It's possible talks will collapse with no reference to cuts to plastic production.\\nI spoke to the Guardian's environment correspondent Sandra Laville about why the sixth (and hopefully final) round of talks are likely to be so fraught and what a good deal could look like.\\nWeather | Gusts of more than 100mph from Storm Floris have brought travel disruption, power cuts and the widespread cancellation of events across large parts of the UK.

Since then, five separate negotiations have failed to secure an agreement. Initially, the idea was for the treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics, but plans have since been watered down.\\nThe last round of talks – held in Busan, South Korea – broke down at the end of last year. “There was some concern we wouldn't even get another meeting,” says Sandra Laville. Country representatives are resuming today for 10 days of talks in Switzerland.\\nAlthough plastic is often seen as a cheap material, it's expensive when you factor in the cost of cleaning up the damage it causes – the latest report found it is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages. And almost all plastic is made from fossil oil and gas. Producing all of this plastic results in greater emissions than those produced by Russia – the world's fourth-largest polluter.\\nAccording to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data, plastic production has increased sharply over the past 70 years. In 1950, the world was producing two million tonnes of plastic to more than 450m tonnes today. Less than 10% of the world's plastic is recycled, and more than 40% is stuck in landfill. “Single-use plastic is the big earner for lots of companies and the petrochemical industry,” says Sandra.\\nThere were a record 220 fossil fuel and chemic industry lobbyists at the December talks in Busan. That was far more than even the host nation's delegation of 140 and was three times the number of independent scientists. Hotel and flight costs make the treaty negotiations expensive to attend, which is why rich industrial interests can flood the talks with lobbyists while smaller countries, scientists and NGOs struggle to find the funds.\\n***\\nWhy is this such a pressing problem for human health?\\nPlastic is, in many ways, a wonder material, but the most rapid increase in production is for single-use plastics, things such as drinks bottles and fast-food packaging, which we sometimes use for a matter of minutes before chucking away. This sort of plastic may be a big earner for companies, but it is not essential for human wellbeing, and the drawbacks are significant.\\nThe latest review, published in the leading medical journal the Lancet, was carried out by leading health researchers and doctors. They found plastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age because they are laced in more than 16,000 chemicals such as fillers, dyes, flame retardants and stabilisers which have been known to damage human health.\\nThe most vulnerable in society are the most at risk. The analysis found that foetuses and infants were subject to harms such as increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth, childhood cancer and fertility problems later in life.\\n***\\nWhat are delegates going to achieve?\\nThere are two groups battling it out in Geneva. One is comprised of more than 100 countries – including the EU – which support legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of single-use plastic products. The other camp are countries with large fossil fuel industries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, who say they don't want any suggestion of tackling plastic production.\\nThe latter group want the agreement to focus on better management and recycling of waste, and for countries to implement voluntary or national measures. “Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China have moved the discussion away from production towards, ‘Oh we just need to manage the waste better, oh we just need to recycle more',” says Sandra.\\nSince 2022, these divisions have become more entrenched. Countries such as Egypt and Malaysia have plastic industry representatives in their national delegations. Meanwhile, the 100 high-ambition countries are not going to fold – the evidence shows we have to reduce plastic production to reduce pollution. “That's why it all collapsed in Busan in December,” says Sandra.\\nThe nature of any agreement is still up the air – it's possible a meaningful treaty will be agreed, or they have further meetings, or some countries agree to pursue a “coalition of the willing” treaty outside the UN. Greenpeace is calling for at least a 75% reduction in plastic production by 2040.\\nBut if an agreement can be reached, it would be the equivalent of getting the Paris agreement for climate negotiations. “You can argue the Paris agreement hasn't done much, but there has been an agreement, and we just haven't had one on plastic pollution. So this is the kind of vacuum that needs to be filled,” says Sandra.\\n***\\nWhat does this say about international environmental diplomacy?\\n“I think there was this real optimism in 2022 when the idea of a treaty was agreed,” says Sandra. Scientists were saying that getting a good agreement could be a gamechanger for cutting plastic pollution. But the winds appear to have changed. “By last November that optimism had all gone.”\\nThe US – which is the world's second-largest producer of plastic after China – has flip-flopped positions during negotiations, but now appears to be aligned with other major fossil fuel producers and is supporting the least ambitious option. China and Iran are also among the countries looking for less ambition, an option they describe as “realistic”. It comes as the Trump administration in the US rolls back environmental policies, including a longstanding finding on greenhouse gas emissions endangering health.\\nAndrés del Castillo, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a non profit providing legal counsel to some countries attending the talks, said oil states were questioning even basic facts about the harm to health caused by plastics. “We are in a moment of revisionism, where even science is highly politicised,” he says.\\nHopes for a “last-chance” ambitious global treaty to curb plastic pollution are looking dim – but a weaker agreement still shows international diplomacy functions. “It doesn't feel as if the world is ready to address any of this,” says Sandra. “I do think that any treaty – as long as it's not really weak – is a good thing to hold up.”\\nNels Abbey is compelling in this column on Kemi Badenoch's “comedic, but sadly revealing” rejection of her Nigerian heritage – not least, he writes, because her life “hardly describes the general Black experience”.

At the coming Cop30 summit in Belém, it hopes to gather support so it can launch negotiations for a new treaty next year. The group's founder, Tzeporah Berman, explains why the Amazon rainforest and the global south are an ideal springboard for the movement.\\nWhy will you be campaigning  for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty?\\nWe have to change the way people think about oil, gas and coal, which are responsible for 86% of the carbon dioxide emissions that are trapped in our atmosphere. The world is on track to produce 110% more oil, gas and coal by 2030 than we can ever burn if we want to keep global warming below 2C [above preindustrial levels]. That's because the market is distorted by trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies.\\nAnd it's only getting worse because every country is trying to artificially keep alive their fossil fuel industries, even though they know the damage they cause. At Cop30, we will be working to expand the group of countries participating in the development of the treaty.\\nWhat do you say to those who say a non-proliferation treaty is unfeasible anytime soon?\\nChange starts that way. When we first talked about renewable energy, people literally laughed at us because it was so expensive. But we've seen a tremendous change in technology and in prices so that today we are powering whole countries with renewable energy. Every day, we see major breakthroughs. Last year, one in five cars sold on the planet was electric. We can change very quickly when we want to.\\nYes, the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is a big new idea, but at this moment in history, with floods, fires and heatwaves sweeping the planet, we need big new ideas.\\nWhat progress have you made since the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative was founded?\\nThe push to negotiate a treaty is endorsed by more than 4,000 civil society groups including all of the world's major faith, health, women's and climate organisations. More than 120 cities have passed motions to support the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and they are increasingly being joined by subnational governments such as California. We also now have 101 Nobel laureates and over 3,000 scientists who have endorsed the treaty. This growing movement helps create the political space for more countries to join.\\nSo far 17 countries are participating in the development of the treaty. In addition, 10 countries have been attending senior officials meetings as observers and are showing significant interest and we hope there will be another string of announcements at and before Belém.\\nBut what are the prospects of achieving a critical mass?\\nTreaties for landmines and chemical weapons started with a core group of just 20 to 30 countries who wanted ambitious, binding rules. That shifted the social norm so it became unacceptable to stockpile those weapons even for many nations who were not signatories to those treaties.\\nToday, fossil fuels are our weapons of mass destruction. They kill more people on this planet every year than anything else. Even before we calculate the toll from climate change, air pollution alone kills 8 million people each year. Fossil fuels are the greatest threat to human life.\\nWe expect to have enough countries next year to begin negotiations. Before and during Cop30 we will be hosting major meetings of senior officials and ministers mapping the pathway toward negotiations, including the key convenings and conferences that need to be held in that process in the months ahead and we hope there will be a significant announcement on progress at Belém, so look out.\\nThis goes beyond the traditional left-right divide, doesn't it?\\nFor me, this all started with the conversations I had in Canada with the oil industry over the tar sands in Alberta. The Trudeau government back then would say: “We know we need to reduce emissions and the world is going to get off fossil fuels but our oil is ethical,” even though the tar sands produce some of the heaviest carbon in the world.\\nI later realised that whether you're in Norway or Ecuador or Argentina, it's the same conversation. Every company wants to produce the last barrel sold. So every year we miss our emissions reduction targets and every year we drill for more oil, we frack for more gas and we dig up more coal. And then we wonder why the system isn't changing, even though renewable energy is cheaper.\\nAs long as there is no supply side climate policy, then we are trying to cut with one half of the scissors by solely focusing on reducing demand. This is true even with supposedly progressive climate leaders in office, such as Trudeau in Canada, Biden in the US or Starmer in Britain. The system has been designed in such a way that, domestically, elected officials don't feel responsible for constraining production. That means we are continuing to put our intellectual, financial and political capital towards expanding a system that we say we're phasing out. And it is almost always the case that what we build today will be what we use tomorrow.\\nWhy do you think the Brazilian climate summit is the place to expand this dialogue?\\nIndigenous nations in the heart of the Amazon campaigned to keep fossil fuels in the ground long before anywhere in the global north. It has now spread across the world from Standing Rock and the tar sands in the US to anti-coal campaigns in Australia and Europe.\\nIn the run-up to Belém, we've been working with indigenous nations and associations across the region to promote the idea of a fossil-free Amazon zone so it can be a model for other parts of the world. We have tremendous support from civil society and significant backing from countries. Colombia was the first to endorse a fossil-free Amazon – a commitment to no oil and gas exploration and extraction in the region – and a global fossil fuel treaty, and it is doing diplomatic outreach to other countries.\\nHow do you tackle climate justice issues?\\nFor the last several years, we've been commissioning studies looking at how to apply equity and finance principles to a negotiation on fossil fuel production: who gets to produce and for how long? This takes in historical responsibility, just transition, social justice and levels of fossil fuel dependency.\\nBrazil – the biggest nation in the Amazon region – has just sold more than 100 oil and gas exploration blocks, including some offshore from the rainforest. How do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil and leaders such as Lula to give up on fossil fuels?\\nAt this moment in history, leadership is important. What Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, said when he joined the fossil fuel treaty was that the science is clear: no new fossil fuel expansion fits in a world where we meet our climate targets. The International Energy Agency has said the same and so has the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The international court of justice has now suggested that is not only a scientific finding but a legal obligation.\\nIt's absurd that there's this constant drumbeat of pledges and speeches to protect the Amazon, to support Lula and other leaders in the Amazon while, at the same time, financing new oil drilling in the heart of the rainforest, in the mouth of the river, and then buying that oil. We need responsibility along the entire chain and we need more than press releases and empty pledges. We need support for Lula and other leaders to move forward with protecting the Amazon and stopping drilling.\\nHow do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil to give up on drilling particular fields?\\nWe've formed a finance working group that has experts predominantly from the global south. They're producing a series of papers on trade agreements, tax agreements, debt relief and market access that would provide countries who have joined the fossil fuel treaty with financial support and benefits, as well as looking at specific just transition funds from the private sector available only to countries participating in the development of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.\\nA larger question is whether or not fossil fuel development in the global south can eliminate poverty. The plans for expansion in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa show the fossil fuel industry using these regions as a gas station for the global north: Europe and North America. They are unlikely to provide significant economic revenue or products to the areas that they're exploiting. There's a tremendous amount of evidence from the last 50 years to show the legacy is more likely to be poisoned waterways and expensive spills. This has been the case for countries that have had fossil fuel development for decades such as Ecuador or Nigeria. The ecological devastation dramatically diminishes local communities' abilities to support themselves.\\nNew fossil fuel infrastructure has high costs and leads to ongoing dependency whereas renewable energy infrastructure creates independence and greater long-term health and economic benefits. But less than 2% of global finance for renewables was in the global south. It's great that we have seen a commitment from governments in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to triple renewables, but we need those commitments to be coupled with commitments to decommission existing fossil fuel assets and to ensure money flows into the global south.\\nWon't the likely absence of the US make it difficult to move forward?\\nWe don't expect the US and other major producers to join at this point and that's fine. That means the treaty being developed will be strong and built by those committed to ambitious action commensurate with the science calling for absolute decline of emissions and production.\\nThe far right is already on the offensive against net zero [emissions targets]. Won't the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative give them an even bigger target?\\nPoliticians can talk about the benefits and costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy all they want, but the real benefit for real people is that the sun doesn't send you a bill at the end of the month. When we build renewable energy infrastructure, that means energy is free for life. Make no mistake about it, renewables are not just a different way of powering our cars and our homes; they're about changing power in every sense of the word.\"]"

         "[\"After clinching the title of top conservative podcast in America (and second overall news podcast, according to Apple's ranking) in March, Charlie Kirk said: “We're not just talking. We're activating a revolution.”\\nIn the hours after his killing at age 31 on the first stop of a buzzy college campus tour, the rightwing activist's words echoed through young conservative circles. Social media eulogies rolled in, with users reposting clips of Kirk with his wife and children. Parents of teens wrote on X of learning about Kirk's death through their children. “My 17 year old is bumming. Told me he plays Charlie in the background on his computer when he's on it,” the conservative radio host Jesse Kelly wrote on X. Another X user wrote about speaking to teens at a church youth group: “Everyone I talked to is so distraught and heartbroken at his passing.”\\nA key figure in Donald Trump's success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk's beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.\\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn't agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events. He was like a gen Z and millennial version of Rush Limbaugh – the rightwing, shock-jock commentator who dominated US airwaves in the 1990s – even if his base had no clue who that was.\\nKirk's ideology was caustic; he espoused openly homophobic, racist, sexist, Islamophobic and Christian nationalist views while uplifting misinformation and conspiracy theories. He also campaigned on issues that mattered to young Americans, engaging directly with them – no matter how virulently – on hot-button topics such as abortion, transgender rights, race and Palestinian solidarity.\\nAmy Binder, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University who studies politics and education, describes Kirk's values as “insurgency conservatism” that was “designed to get attention”.\\nIt worked: TikTok users under 30 who voted for Trump in 2024 said they trusted Kirk more than any other individual, according to a New York Times profile, despite the fact that he never held office or a role in the White House. That election saw male voters ages 18 to 29 swing hard to the right; Trump also made inroads with gen Z women. Earlier this year, Trump praised Kirk for “what he's done with the young people”.\\nAs a millennial growing up in the Chicago suburbs, Kirk was obsessed with Limbaugh and the Tea Party movement. His fans also felt like outsiders within the American political system.\\n“After Trump was elected in 2016, I was really surprised to see just how many students who were conservative were no longer identifying with the Republican party or with college Republicans, and had instead pivoted over to being really intrigued with what Turning Point was doing on campus,” Binder said. “They were doing much more exciting programming. It was less electorally focused, less about campaigning, and more about having events that were really confrontational.”\\nKirk appeared equally at ease chumming it up with high-powered donors as he did debating 20-year-olds in sweatpants. Kirk sparred directly with young people through video templates such as “prove me wrong” (a one-on-one debate, where students could wait in line to ask him a question), and he was an early guest on the YouTube series Surrounded, where he sat in a room with 25 liberals and goaded them with statements such as “abortion is murder and should be illegal” and “trans women are not women.”\\nTurning Point USA raked in funding – the New York Times estimated a $92.4m revenue in 2023 – while advancing campus culture wars. Kirk's content brought classic and extreme rightwing ideals to young people's media feeds; he looked like both an old-school, suited conservative in the style of a Fox News host, and a social media-savvy man of the times. His video titles usually bent toward hyperbole (“Charlie Kirk Crushes Woke Lies at Michigan State,” was posted less than a week before the shooting). There were gonzo premises, such as when Kirk and the YouTube prank team Nelk Boys showed up at a Wisconsin frat party to get out the vote in 2024. His meme literacy showed when he handed out hats that read: “White Boy Summer”, a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's “Hot Girl Summer” catchphrase.\\nWith his wife, Erika, owner of a faith-based fashion brand and a former Miss Arizona USA, Kirk softened his image, presenting himself as devoted husband, father and a bit of a lifestyle influencer. He talked to tweens in Maga hats about his preferred Starbucks order and promoted “cuteservatives” like Alex Clark, a Turning Point USA podcaster who branded her show on Maha culture as a rightwing Call Her Daddy. After Kirk's death, Brett Cooper, a 23-year-old conservative influencer in the “womanosphere” with more than 1 million Instagram followers, reposted a video homage that depicted him as a champion for girls and young women. (Yet this was a man who compared abortion to the Holocaust and claimed that women over 30 “aren't attractive in the dating pool”.)\\nFor 10 years, Turning Point USA hosted a “women's summit”, where Kirk and others like Clark and Cooper encouraged attenders to focus on finding husbands. Evie, the conservative women's magazine, published an obituary that called Kirk a “loving father, patriot, and husband”.\\nEven young people who were disgusted by Kirk's rhetoric could not deny his impact. Hasan Piker, the hugely popular leftwing Twitch streamer whose ideology stands in direct contrast to Kirk, was scheduled to debate with Kirk at the end of September at Dartmouth University. Both Piker and the gun control activist David Hogg spoke against political violence in the wake of the shooting (as did many Democratic figures such as Joe Biden, Gavin Newsom and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani). Piker told his followers not to make jokes about Kirk's shooting. “This is a terrifying incident,” Piker said. Hogg called the news “horrifying” on X.\\n“I think it's undeniable to say that Kirk was one of the first and most prominent people to shape what it means to be young and on the right in the US,” said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of communications at American University who studies extremism.\\nAfter Kirk's death, Braddock said he had seen “individuals calling this an inflection point, or a turning point where the left can no longer be tolerated”. Rightwing pundits have been eager to blame the left for the shooting.\\nAdam Pennings, 25, is the executive director of Run Gen Z, a non-profit that supports young Republican candidates. “He's always just been such an important part” of the young conservative party, Pennings said of Kirk. “He was everywhere.”\\nPennings knew Kirk through his work, but the two were not close. Still, Pennings said, due to Kirk's omnipresence: “I feel like I lost a friend.”\", \"Charlie Kirk's death by a shooter's bullet on a university campus in Utah on Wednesday has left the United States, a country already grappling with mounting political anger and polarization, in a state of profound shock bordering on despair.\\nKirk, a rising star of Donald Trump's make America great again (Maga) movement, was struck in the neck by a single shot as he addressed a large student crowd at Utah Valley University. The event had been billed as the grand opening of his 15-stop “America Comeback Tour”, but instead will be marked as the place where he uttered his last words.\\nThe 31-year-old leader of the rightwing student group Turning Point USA was about 20 minutes into a Q&A, ironically engaging with a question on mass shootings in America, when the shot rang out. Within seconds, hundreds of students had scattered screaming from the campus lawn.\\nWithin minutes of that, gruesome videos began to proliferate through social media, apparently undeterred by any algorithm. They showed Kirk being hit, slumping to his left side and profusely bleeding.\\nLong before Kirk was pronounced dead at 4.40pm – poignantly in a post from his champion, the US president, on Truth Social – the wave of profound shock was breaking over both sides of the US's political divide.\\n“This is horrific. I am stunned,” said the Republican senator from Texas Ted Cruz, who described Kirk on Twitter/X as a “good friend” since the young activist's teenage years.\\nKirk was unashamedly far to the right of the US political spectrum and had expressed openly bigoted views and engaged in homophobic and Islamophobic rhetoric. He recently tweeted: “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.”\\nHe mixed evangelical Christian beliefs with rightwing politics into a combustible brew. During an appearance with Trump in Georgia last fall, he claimed that Democrats “stand for everything God hates”, adding: “This is a Christian state. I'd like to see it stay that way.”\\nBut mourning for Kirk crossed the political aisle.\\nJoe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's Morning Joe who has been unrestrained at times in his criticism of Kirk's political posturing, called the shooting “tragic and sickening”. He added: “Violence targeting political public figures is violence against American democracy itself and the freedom of every American to express their views.”\\nTommy Vietor, a former staffer in Barack Obama's White House, issued an even darker warning. Political violence, he said, was a “cancer that will feed off itself and spread … it will rip this country apart”.\\nThe political violence that Vietor identified is etched into the US's psyche. The country has had to absorb the assassinations of four sitting presidents including Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, as well as the tragic trilogy of 1960s shootings of Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr.\\nThose grim historic landmarks were brought slamming back into public consciousness by the assassination attempt on Trump at a presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024. Trump survived that incident by a hair's breadth, which he has since claimed to be an act of God's will. A second would-be assassin later waited for Trump on a Florida golf course before being discovered in the nick of time by his security detail.\\nAt the same time America has been rocked by the killing on the streets of Manhattan of a top healthcare executive, and in June an attack in Minnesota saw a gunman brutally shoot a local lawmaker dead in her own home.\\nKirk's death – though the precise motive behind his killing remains so far unknown – leaves the US standing on the edge of a new abyss, over which a black cloud now looms over the safety of its public figures and the sanctity of its public debate.\\n“What the actual hell have we become?” asked the Catholic writer Emily Zanotti, speaking for many. In a comment under her X feed, another poster said: “We have met the enemy, and he is us.”\\nDylan Housman, editor-in-chief of the rightwing news outlet the Daily Caller, also expressed foreboding. “We can't live in a country where things like this happen,” he said.\\nFor months now the temperature of the US's political discourse has been rising. As JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, put it following the Kirk shooting: “Political violence unfortunately has been ratcheting up in this country.”\\nIn June a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota, Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed in a shooting. Federal and state judges have reported a plethora of threats, including deliveries of unsolicited pizzas to their homes in grotesque reference to the 2020 killing of Daniel Anderl, the son of a New Jersey district judge Esther Salas.\\nKirk's killing takes this booming scourge of discourse-by-bullet to another level. The location of the shooting in itself indicates that there might be trouble ahead, as the TV political journalist Chuck Todd noted. “On a college campus, no less, a place where we should be celebrating speech, not trying to silence it.”\\nThe identity of the victim, too, raises the stakes dramatically. Kirk was the golden boy of the Maga movement, a Trump favorite.\\nThe president called Kirk “legendary” in his post announcing the death. The Turning Point leader was boosted to nationwide prominence when he was taken on as personal aide to Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\\nKirk's ascent within the Maga firmament was as fiery as the trademark pyrotechnical displays that opened his Turning Point “people's conventions”. The speakers he attracted on stage were like a roll-call of Maga royalty – JD Vance, former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, entrepreneur and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and many more.\\nBy Wednesday night consternation had already begun to be aired about how the Trump administration, and the wider Maga movement, would respond to the loss of one of their dearly beloved own. “There are people who are fomenting [political violence] in this country,” Pritzker said. “The president's rhetoric often foments it.”\\nLater this month, Kirk had a stop on his Comeback Tour scheduled at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. On 25 September he was scheduled to debate the progressive influencer, Hasan Piker.\\nAfter Kirk's shooting, Piker spoke out about his fears on his live stream. “This is a terrifying incident,” he said. “The reverberation of people seeking out vengeance in the aftermath of this violent, abhorrent incident is going to be genuinely worrisome.”\", \"Charlie Kirk, the founder of the powerful rightwing youth activist group Turning Point USA (TPUSA) and a close ally of Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday afternoon while speaking at a university campus event in Utah. \\nHis death shocked the nation as members of both political parties expressed outrage at the killing. Spencer Cox, the Utah governor, called the shooting a “political assassination”, though a motive is not yet known and the shooter remained at large on Wednesday night. \\n“This is a dark day for our state. It's a tragic day for our nation,” Cox, a Republican, said at a press conference, appealing for an end to the political violence that has stalked the country in recent months.\\nKirk was killed while speaking on the campus of Utah Valley University (UVU), near Salt Lake City, as part of the American Comeback Tour, which is hosted by the university's Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter and was attended by as many as 3,000 people, according to Jeffrey Long, the police chief at the university.\\nDetails about the shooter's identity and motive are still unknown, but state authorities said they believed the incident was a “targeted attack”. Kirk was about 20 minutes into a presentation when a single shot was fired at him, the university said.\\nTrump announced Kirk's death in a social media post, and ordered all American flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of the 31-year-old conservative youth leader. “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” Trump wrote, adding: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.”\\nThe president, along with other prominent conservatives, was also quick to fan the flames of division by blaming the “radical left political violence” for Kirk's killing. In a speech in the Oval Office, Trump called Kirk the “best of America”, and listed acts of violence that he attributed to the left while omitting violence against Democrats, such as the killing of a Minnesota state lawmaker.\\n“For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today and it must stop right now,” Trump said in his speech.\\nThrough the day, two suspects were separately taken into custody but ultimately released. One person detained at the scene, George Zinn, was deemed not to be a suspect but was charged with obstructing justice. A second person taken into custody was released after being interviewed. Neither had ties to the shooting, according to the university.\\nBystander footage of the shooting and its aftermath captured a chaotic scene. In videos circulating on social media, Kirk can be seen being struck in the neck by a bullet while speaking beneath a tent in the UVU courtyard in Orem, Utah. Video footage also shows students scrambling to run from the sound of gunfire. Kirk was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died, authorities said.\\nLocal and campus police, the FBI and the Utah department of public safety are investigating the incident.\\nBeau Mason, the commissioner of Utah's department of public safety, said investigators were reviewing security camera images of the suspect, who wore dark clothing and possibly fired “a longer-distance shot” from a roof.\\nLaw enforcement officials briefly took two people into custody before releasing them. One person was detained at the scene but deemed not to be a suspect, and the second person was released after being interviewed by police. Neither of the individuals had ties to the shooting, authorities said.\\nAt the press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Cox pledged that authorities would find the shooter and hold them “accountable to the furthest extent of the law”.\\n“And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah,” Cox said.\\nIn an internal email to staff members posted online on Wednesday, Justin Streiff, Turning Point USA COO, said: “It is with a heavy heart that we, the Turning Point USA leadership team, write to notify you that earlier this afternoon Charlie went to his eternal reward with Jesus Christ in Heaven … However, in the meantime, Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action will be closed for business until Monday, the 15th – likely longer.”\\nUVU announced that it would be closed for the remainder of the week and classes and other events would be suspended until Monday. In a statement, the university president said the campus was “shocked and saddened” by the violence and offered condolences to Kirk's family.\\n“We grieve with our students, faculty, and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy,” Astrid Tuminez said. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here. We do not condone any form of violence at UVU and seek to make our campus a safe place for all.”\\nEyewitnesses said Kirk was being questioned about mass shootings when he was shot in the neck.\\nA Deseret News reporter, Emma Pitts, who was at the event, said that Kirk was on his second question and that it was “regarding mass shootings”.\\n“The person he was debating had asked about if he knew how many mass shootings had involved a transgender shooter, to which Kirk responded,” Pitts said. “[Then] he asked how many mass shootings had [there] been in the last couple of years” and “before he could even answer, we heard a gunshot and we just saw Charlie Kirk's neck turn to the side and it appeared that he had been shot in the neck”.\\n“There was blood, immediately a lot of blood,” Pitts said. “After the shots were fired, everyone immediately took to the ground … we were just trying to stay hidden.”\\nThen, Pitts said, “everyone started running away”.\\nThe shooting drew condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum.\\n“Political violence has no place in America,” said Kamala Harris in a statement. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, expressed a similar sentiment: “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.”\\nMike Lee, a Utah senator, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was an American patriot … This murder was a cowardly act of violence, an attack on champions of freedom like Charlie, the students who gathered for civil debate, and all Americans who peacefully strive to save our nation. The terrorists will not win. Charlie will. Please join me in praying for his wife Erika and their children. May justice be swift.”\\nSam Levin contributed reporting\"]"

         "[\"On an overcast Tuesday in July, divers Mitch Johnson and Sean Taylor shimmy into their wetsuits on the back of the R/V Xenarcha, a 28ft boat floating off the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles. Behind them, the clear waters of the Pacific are dotted with a forest of army-green strands, waving like mermaid hair underwater.\\nWe are here to survey the giant Pacific kelp, a species that once thrived in these ice cold waters. But over the past two decades, a combination of warm ocean temperatures, pollution, overfishing and the proliferation of hungry sea urchins that devour the kelp has led to an 80% decline in the forest along the southern California coast.\\nIn recent years, scientists have staged a comeback – mounting one of the largest and most successful kelp restoration projects in the world. To do so, they've recruited an army of hammer-wielding divers to smash and clean up the voracious urchins. Today's trip is a chance to see that success up close.\\nSeen from the boat's edge, the kelp fronds are so thick and sturdy at places that they form mats at the ocean's surface, sturdy enough for egrets and herons to perch on while they poked at the fish beneath. These waters host a multitude of species, from bright orange garibaldi fish and white sharks that silently cruise the coastline to blue whales which sail through the deep channel a few miles to our east.\\nDivers like Johnson and Taylor have a variety of tools at their disposal. Some days, they pick up rock hammers – like an underwater version of the seven dwarves – and dive to crack open the ravenous purple urchins that destroy the baby kelp. But today, they are armed only with a tape and a camera to survey the status of this gigantic concealed forest.\\nGear on, the divers give a thumbs-up to Tom Ford, chief executive officer of the Bay Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to restoring Santa Monica Bay and its coastal waters, who is piloting the boat. With a small splash, they disappear into the water. Ford and I wait, with the quiet slapping of waves on the side of the Xenarcha, to see what they find.\\nLed by the Bay Foundation, divers in the Santa Monica Bay have spent 15,575 hours underwater over the past 13 years. To bring the kelp back, they focus on minimizing the impact of one voracious eater: the purple urchin. The effort has been successful, smashing 5.8 million purple urchins and clearing 80.7 acres (32.7 hectares, the size of 61 football fields), and allowing the kelp to return.\\nBut with the results contained far offshore and underwater, has anyone noticed? Ford wonders the same thing. “We call it the forgotten forest,” he says.\\nThe fast-growing kelp ecosystems are known as the “sequoias of the sea” for good reason: they store large amounts of carbon, create habitat for more than 800 marine species and blunt the powerful force of storm waves. Technically, they are a macro-algae, and can grow as much as 2ft each day, reaching 100ft from reef bed to surface.\\nFor those lucky enough to see the kelp from under the waves, it can feel like a fairytale – a forest, but instead of walking through it, you're flying underwater.\\nFord still remembers the first time he dived into the forest as a scuba diver. The sunlight looked like tongues of flame rippling through the blades from underwater, and the shafts of light peeked through the small holes in the canopy. “It looked like a cathedral, with light shooting through the stained glass,” he says. “And sometimes you float down through this and there's thousands of fish of all sorts of colors just flitting around everywhere. It's like flying through an unimaginably dense forest of life.”\\nBut for a time, these glorious environments were at risk of disappearing. When the Bay Foundation started working in these waters in 2012, the sea bed looked like carpets of purple – blanketed in endemic golf ball-sized spiky urchins.\\nIt was a symptom of an ecosystem gone haywire, with multiple overlapping injuries: sea otters, which eat urchins as a staple of their diet, were almost wiped out by hunters in the 19th century. Then, from the 1940s to the 1970s, a large amount of DDT was discharged from a chemical plant into the sea off Palos Verdes. Sediment from landslides also buried the reefs in silt, preventing anything from growing. More recently, the local sea stars, which eat the urchins, were hit with a wasting disease, and turned to goo. All that was left was urchins, which eat kelp at an incredible rate, and scratched the reef bed so much that any kelp spores still circulating couldn't grab a foothold.\\nFord and the Bay Foundation did multiple tests to determine the optimal amount of urchins per square meter: two. Meanwhile, some areas of the barrens had 70-80 urchins per meter. Since they didn't have much to eat, they were basically empty zombie urchins – hungry, empty of their meat, just hanging on and preventing kelp from growing. There was a lot to do.\\nThe Bay Foundation applied for grants from the state and federal authorities and started hiring divers, gathering 75 volunteers, and even working with commercial fishers to help out. Ford points out that the team was not smashing the healthy urchins that people depend on for their livelihood. “We were paying the fishermen to put back the forest, and then they could then go back in and fish from there again,” he says.\\nThat's the case with Terry Herzik, a longtime red sea urchin fisher, who started working with the foundation in 2012, spending nine hours a day smashing urchins instead of collecting them for sale. “No one has more hours down there clearing urchins than Terry,” says Ford, gesturing to Herzik's boat, the Sun Spot, which is anchored nearby. “We could not have achieved this without him.”\\nSlowly, methodically, divers ventured down out and smashed urchins week after week, clearing the plots. Hitting an urchin with a foot-long rock hammer gives “a satisfying crunch”, Johnson says. He is quick to point out that this is manual labor, just underwater (and while wearing a cumbersome scuba suit).\\nThe divers talk about their job almost as if they are part of a construction crew – it's repetitive work, but fulfilling, like filling potholes in the ocean. “You just tap, tap, and sometimes you have to reach into crevices to get the urchins out,” says Taylor. “Your forearms get super tired.”\\nBut the real benefit is seeing how quickly the kelp returns when the urchins are under control – in some cases within a matter of months. That's because the microscopic single-celled kelp spores are wafting in the water column all the time – much like seeds of a plant carried by the wind – waiting for the right conditions to attach to the reef and start growing.\\nJohnson remembers one spot along the coast that he worked on. “Within three months, the kelp came back,” he says. “I've never seen a kelp forest that dense – and it was insane to see how quickly it returned.”\\nTaylor and Johnson, who both work for the Bay Foundation, resurface and haul themselves on to the back of the boat. Shaking the sea water out of their hair, they describe what they saw in the survey area: tons of fish, a small shark and a forest of green.\\n“There's still a lot of kelp,” Johnson tells Ford, but it's not all good news. “There's still a pocket where the urchins are expanding out.” It's still a mystery why some areas stay restored with kelp, while others return to barrens.\\nThe boat moves on to another point on the coast, where the divers descend again. Here, the kelp forest is so thick that it forms a mat keeping the boat in place.\\n“I don't know if we need to anchor,” Ford says. “I'll just let the algae hold me.”\\nFord and I lift up a kelp frond from the edge of the boat. It's slippery, rubbery and slightly slimy. On the top, I can see a colony of bryozoans – tiny filter-feeding invertebrates that live on the surface of the kelp. Teensy shrimp and snails also gather on the fronds: evidence of its importance as a habitat for so many creatures. I run my fingers along the blades that are just starting to differentiate and grow the bulbs that keep the structure afloat. Even as a parent to fast-growing children, it's hard to imagine the speed at which this algae moves – always upward, always out. “Everything flows from the kelp.” Ford says.\\nThe project could be a model for other parts of the world where kelp is struggling. In Tasmania and South Korea, efforts are under way to save kelp. California's Santa Barbara channel is also a target for future restoration work.\\nWith blobs of warmer oceans in a climate-changed future, kelp may still be at risk – but there are hopeful signs. The sites that have been restored remain mostly intact. The foundation's research shows that California spiny lobster have returned to the area, and fish such as kelp bass and sheepshead are more abundant now than before restoration work started. The kelp also improves water quality, absorbing excess nutrients, and keeps sediments in place in a similar way that trees hold the land from sliding after rains. And the improvements even benefited the valuable red sea urchins – in sites where the kelp has been restored, red sea urchin gonads (the prized parts, also known as uni) weigh 168% more.\\nWhile the effect of the urchins has been devastating, Ford points out that kelp has always faced challenges: from powerful waves that rip out the strands from the seabed, to summertime temperatures that kill off the nutrients needed to grow. That has made the kelp super-resilient – and ready to pounce at any opportunity to regrow. “Part of the reason why we see such a rapid response to the restoration is because the system has evolved to respond rapidly to beneficial conditions,” he says.\\nPerhaps the kelp will have a fairytale future after all – one that helps the planet, the people and the coastline into the next century.\", \"Rodd Kelsey gazed out on the golden slopes of Point Reyes national seashore sweeping down to the rugged California coastline, pointing to the patches laden with invasive stalks of prickly thistle and browning sod. These are some of the hallmarks of the region's recent history, he said – but they also showcase the opportunities for its future.\\nA new chapter is unfolding on the striking landscape located some 70 miles (113km) north of San Francisco. The unique patchwork of wild and pastoral ranges operated by the National Park Service (NPS) has spent decades mired in battles between local ranchers operating on the lands and environmentalists who see their presence as a blight.\\nAs part of a settlement reached early this year, 12 organic dairies and cattle operations agreed to take a multimillion-dollar buyout – the financial details of which have been largely kept secret – and were given 15 months to move off the land.\\nThe deal opened more than 16,000 acres (6,475 hectares) for conservation, left in the hands of the Nature Conservancy, the international conservation non-profit that financed and mediated the agreement. As the group's California land program director, Kelsey is among those shepherding the enormous, five-year restoration effort.\\nLast week, California legislators awarded $2.7m in state funding to the plan, out of a $10m fund set aside for Point Reyes's restoration.\\nBut eight months after the settlement was signed, tensions are still raw in the picturesque communities tucked against the seashore.\\nConcerns about how California will replace the lost supply of organic dairy linger as multigenerational ranchers wind down more than a century of work. There are questions about the way the deal was brokered, and whether the Nature Conservancy's plans will meet the critical environmental challenges that are only intensifying as the world warms.\\nIt's a future laced with both hope and heartbreak. But after what Kelsey called “a very painful transition”, he's eager to focus on what lies ahead.\\nPoint Reyes is still considered a biodiversity hotspot – one of 25 regions on earth most abundant with life with “the threat of loss most severe”, according to the NPS. From coastal sand dunes to tree-covered ridges, its dynamic terrain is a refuge for rare plants and animals, including more than 50 plants and 50 animals listed as threatened or endangered.\\nThe landscapes have also undergone considerable change due to human disruption. There are more than 300 species of aggressive, non-native plants spreading in Point Reyes, roughly 10% of which are a direct threat to ecosystems.\\nBut buried beneath a blanket of weeds lie layers of native seeds waiting for the chance to be resown. The goal – to create a resilient mosaic of vegetation and terrain that helps biodiversity thrive – depends on the right plants having space to reach for the sun.\\nTo help them, Kelsey and a team of partners are planning to rely on what was once considered an environmental adversary: cows.\\nWith a coalition of scientists, conservationists, tribal members and the NPS, the Nature Conservancy has begun outlining a restoration proposal where new herds will be brought in not for milk, but for targeted grazing – a crucial tool, they say, for removing invasive plants and making space for native ones to regrow.\\nSome spots will require heavy intervention. Others, a lighter touch. The team will also use mowing and prescribed burning to eradicate what the cows can't chomp. The idea is ambitious, but it's also been tested. The Nature Conservancy already manages roughly 400,000 former ranch lands across California and is incorporating research done at its other properties where coastal grasslands have been restored.\\nThe stakes are high: if successful, this living laboratory could inform conservation efforts around the world and provide insights into how to sustain native ecosystems alongside livestock. What's learned here could help this region and others soften the blow as the climate crisis unfolds.\\n“Three to four years from now, we will have learned a lot and we will be charting a course for the future,” Kelsey said. “That's part of the experiment here.”\\nIt's a controversial approach with a set of steep challenges, but Kelsey is confident.\\n“Remarkably, these native plants that have mostly disappeared from coastal ecosystems just start popping back up,” he added. “It's latent and sitting in there, waiting to respond.”\\nOn a warm August morning, sunshine pierced the fog that shrouds the seashore even in summer. Clusters of cows could be seen dotting the hillsides, the smell of manure hanging heavy on the salted ocean breeze. Nearby, a herd of tule elk, endemic to this region of California, gathered on the horizon, a large bull at the center bugling loudly to the delight of tourists battling the gusty winds to catch a glimpse.\\nThis corner of west Marin county has long been a popular destination for nature lovers and foodies alike. Millions of visitors come each year for its wild beaches and trails with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, as well as the organic produce, dairy and cheese. After the national seashore was designated in 1962 with a unique deal that secured dairies' ties to their historic lands within the park, agriculture, nature and recreation coexisted, forming the fabric of the region.\\nBut the bucolic scenes masked the battles brewing in the local communities over the beloved area that was also imperiled by intensive land use and the extreme conditions wreaked by the climate crisis.\\n“A lot of the non-native grasses were introduced because they were good for forage or brought inadvertently,” Kelsey said of the plants now blanketing the hillsides. Manure spread over the pastures over the years changed the soils and encouraged their spread, while extensive water use drained moisture from already parched systems.\\nFights also ignited over fencing put up by the ranches that limited the range of wildlife, including the tule elk. When California's recent drought desiccated the region and left scores of animals cut off from water sources, the situation sparked fierce local protests.\\nNext year, many of the fences will come down. Instead, conservationists will rely on “virtual” fencing to more precisely manage grazing cows, an “emerging technology”, Kelsey said, that uses a GPS signal programmed to a collar and has been tested on the Nature Conservancy's 14,000-acre (5,665-hectare) preserve to the south in San Luis Obispo county.\\n“It is really going to be a gamechanger in managing cows carefully but opening up the landscape for things like elk so they can move around more freely,” he said.\\nThe Nature Conservancy will work closely with local stakeholders and stewards, including the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria and the NPS, who both declined to speak to the Guardian for this story.\\nWhile early phases of the plan are focused on invasive plant removal, groups of researchers are already preparing for step two: planting the prairies with a mix of natives that will encourage resilience and diversity.\\n“It's kind of like the ocean,” Donna Faure, executive director of the Point Reyes National Seashore Association (PRNSA), said, walking through a sea of swaying yellow grasses. “It all looks kind of the same but it's different underneath.” The PRNSA has worked closely with the NPS, and funded the first phase of native seed research being used to inform restoration plans.\\nThe need feels urgent: California's native grasslands have been decimated, with less than 1% remaining. Northern coastal prairie, considered one of the most diverse grasslands – and home to close to a third of the state's threatened and endangered species – still grows wild in Point Reyes, and the PRNSA is working quickly to expand it.\\nHelping native plants thrive has a documented impact on other species. Plant communities support a range of insect populations that other creatures, including birds, feed on. The work will be done in close coordination with local communities, rooted in research and science with room to adjust based on monitored successes, according to Faure and Kelsey.\\n“Having a diverse mosaic sets the table for the whole cascading effects in the system,” Kelsey said. “It literally translates to more baby birds because there's more food.”\\nAs conservationists excitedly step into their new roles as stewards, others are lamenting what will be lost as part of Point Reyes's new direction. The ranches now being dissembled were some of the few remaining producers of organic dairy in the region.\\n“Everything I have worked for is being threatened,” said Albert Straus, the founder of Straus Family Creamery, the first certified organic creamery in the US. He dedicated his life to securing and supporting sustainability-focused dairy operations and is working to secure carbon neutrality in his business and the 13 farms supplying it by 2030. \\nThe settlement won't mean the end of his business, but it will create more challenges for the creamery, said Straus, since many of his organic suppliers are now leaving the area and finding new ones will be tough.\\nStraus sees the settlement as the final straw following years of hardship, inflicted by perennial legal challenges, and the broader struggles of 21st-century dairy farming – another disastrous step toward a future that favors factory farms. Many of the milk cows that once graced the picturesque hillsides in Point Reyes have been sold for slaughter or to large-scale dairies far less dedicated to animal welfare and limiting their environmental footprint.\\n“There are ways of working to show local food production is really an asset and a benefit to society and to the community,” he said. “In a climate where we are importing a lot of our food, we are at risk.”\\nHe feels that the agriculture industry and the community more broadly has been betrayed by the NPS, which was able to acquire the lands in the 1960s under an agreement that ranches would be able to remain there. He said the dairies opted in to the voluntary buyouts under duress, exhausted from years of legal defense and the inability to thrive financially or invest long-term into upgrading infrastructure. Straus has also been a strong advocate for the ranch workers displaced by the shutdown of the dairies, many of whom lived on the lands where they worked.\\nHis concerns echo those of the wider dairy industry. Farmers are dealing with the climate crisis, drought, economic pressure and more. Young people are leaving the business or being deterred by the obstacles of getting started.\\n“We went from 4.6m dairy farms in the US in 1940 to about 24,000 today,” Straus said. “The average age of farmers is 60 years old. We don't have a future generation.”\\nStraus is not giving up. He is working to pull together community resources that he hopes will revitalize area farms.\\nBut even as some lawsuits over the settlement remain and the Republican-led House committee on natural resources has launched an investigation into how the agreement came about, most of the dairy operations have begun to move on.\\n“Our family, and our neighbors' families, have loved and cared for this land for generations, and it has been a very difficult decision to leave,” said ranchers Kevin and Nancy Lunny in a statement issued with the settlement announcement. “While this transition will be painful, we believe it's ultimately what is best for our family, given the difficult circumstances.”\\nThe last of the ranches is expected to clear its cows by the end of September.\\n“Even though we have lost these dairies, I am hoping we can rebuild in the future,” Straus said. He's garnered the interest of the Department of the Interior, which he says is looking at solutions that will help them move forward.\\nLily Verdone, who heads the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, an organization working to secure the county's agricultural legacy and support local farmers and ranchers, acknowledged how challenging the changes in Point Reyes have been to the community, but said they are also ready for a change.\\n“It feels very heavy because it's been such a buildup over time and such a struggle,” she said. But the obstacles extend far past the seashore. From economic pressures to environmental ones, it's been increasingly challenging to make ends meet.\\n“Agriculture, and especially dairies, have been losing ground in the region – across the country – for a long time,” she added. “We have to look at the future and say: how can we invest back in?”\\nThe settlement didn't secure a full eradication of agriculture from the park. The NPS is negotiating long-term leases for two ranching operations within Point Reyes. Nine others are spread across the national seashore and its sister park, the Golden Gate national recreation area.\\nSome environmentalist groups remain skeptical of the cows' continued presence on the lands. But as both sides adapt to an uneasy truce, all eyes are on the project and whether it will make good on its promises. \\n“This is a problem a century in the making. None of this is going to happen super fast,” Kelsey said, adding that it won't be possible to take the landscapes back to where they were centuries ago, before humans more deeply intervened. Something new is being created.\\nAnd healing Point Reyes means more than just healing the land – it's also about healing the community's divisions left over by the years-long battles.\\n“The whole reason there's such a fight over this landscape is because people care deeply about this place,” Kelsey said. “We want to set the table but there's a point in the future where [the Nature Conservancy] steps back and the community is doing the good work for the decades to come.”\\nThey will need local support and dedication to see it through.\\n“What makes a resilient landscape? It's the people who care,” said Tom Gardali, CEO of Audubon Canyon Ranch, one of the partners working with the Nature Conservancy. “It is going to take a community to care for this land, not just in terms of a near-term restoration, but for the long term.”\", \"The morning begins with a sense of anticipation – the calm before 1,200lbs of explosives detonate a stream culvert buried 10ft in Alaska's Tongass national forest.\\nJamie Daniels, 53, and his crew of Tlingit forestry workers take cover in a glade of alders.\\nA few minutes earlier, together with the US Forest Service and a Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition (SAWC) watershed scientist, they fed high-grade explosives into the galvanized steel culvert on a 40ft sled made of spruce trees. The goal now is to vaporize it, along with the rocks on top.\\nCrouched 1,000ft away from the blast site, Jack Greenhalgh, the US Forest Service master blaster veteran, shouts: “Fire in the hole!”\\nHe presses a remote detonator. Seconds later, four 50lb bags of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (Anfo) go off.\\nA boom echoes across the valley, and the air goes liquid as a shockwave sweeps over the group, causing workers to grip hard hats. Football-sized splinters of granite shoot into the sky. Leaves flutter to the ground. A cloud of acrid smoke blows over.\\n“Stand by until we clear the area,” Greenhalgh mumbles, climbing out from behind his berm to inspect the damage – or success, depending on how one looks at it.\\nThe area where the group works is called Cube Cove, a 22,000-acre (8,900-hectare) addition to the 1m-acre Kootznoowoo wilderness on Admiralty Island, where the Tlingit people have lived, hunted and fished for at least 10,000 years. The wilderness makes up a chunk of the 17m-acre Tongass – by far the largest national forest in the United States.\\nThe Tlingit have long considered Admiralty Island, or Kootznoowoo, as sacred ground – a place of spiritual significance, ancestral knowledge and connection to a traditional subsistence lifestyle. Chartreuse-colored leaves of the spiny devil's club, mustard-colored seaweed on the rocks and citrus-scented spruce tips create a distinct rainforest aroma.\\nKootznoowoo means “fortress of the bear”, a fitting name for a landscape home to the highest density of brown bears in North America. The landscape carries the marks of centuries of stewardship – from strips of yellow cedar used for ceremonial baskets to totem poles reflecting intricate clan histories. Eagles soar high above, chalky heads on pivot as they watch for herring or juvenile salmon.\\nThis morning, Daniels wears a bright orange safety helmet, his hands calloused from carving a 12in (30cm) block of Sitka spruce into a brown bear's head. He lives in Angoon, 15 miles (24km) south of Cube Cove along the coast of the island, population 341. His clan house is shd'een hit, the Steel house, and he comes from Deisheetaan Naahaachuneidii, the original Raven Beaver clan of the Edge of the Nation people.\\nDaniels emerges onto the old logging road, and gestures across the valley. “All of this, it's not just land to us. It's our ancestors' land. We're here doing more than just fixing roads or removing culverts – we're reconnecting with our history, our identity and our future. Every culvert we remove, that's a promise to our children that the land will heal.”\\nIn the 1970s, Daniels's relatives along with others from Angoon fought to protect the island from clearcutting, holding bake sales, bingo games and raffles to fund trips to Washington DC. In 1978, elders met with Jimmy Carter. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) formalized protections for the Kootznoowoo wilderness, now part of the Admiralty Island national monument.\\nHowever, that designation came with an asterisk: the sale of 22,890 acres of ancestral Tlingit hunting and fishing grounds to the Shee Atiká Corporation, one of the 13 Native corporations created during the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971.\\nOver the next three decades, more than 80% of that land was clearcut. Culverts, like the one the team is blowing up today, were inserted, blocking the passage of baby salmon upriver.\\nIn 2020, the forest service purchased the Cube Cove land from Shee Atiká for $18m. The agency, alongside Kootznoowoo Inc, the Indigenous corporation based in Angoon, and SAWC, embarked on a five-year project to restore ecological functions, reconnect streams and support the traditional practices of the Tlingit people. The addition of Cube Cove signified the largest transfer of land into formal wilderness designation in the forest service's history.\\n“The purchase of this land opened a door,” Daniels reflects. “It gave us the chance to reconnect with these lands in a way that honors our ancestors and what they knew – how to live in harmony with nature, not dominate it.”\\nWhen he was growing up in Angoon, Daniels recalls, his uncles and cousins talked about hunting and fishing in the area before the clearcutting.\\n“My grandmother spoke of a ‘small sockeye run' from here. I always thought she was talking about just a few fish. But actually, it's thousands of fish – just kokanee salmon, which look like small sockeye.”\\nSince 2022, Daniels and his crew – including his 24-year-old son Justin; 33-year-old Roger Williams; and 41-year-old Walt Washington – have been working to undo decades of damage.\\n“We're trying to get this forest back on its feet,” Daniels explains. “But it's not just the trees. We're restoring the entire ecosystem: the fish, the wildlife and the cultural traditions connected to this land.”\\nFollowing the all-clear from Greenhalgh, SAWC watershed scientist Kelsey Dean slings a forest service Pulaski – part ax and part adze – over her shoulder and follows the old logging road to the blast site. She describes dense thickets of spruce as “dog hair trees” where deer can't forage, and bears can't hunt deer.\\nThis six-day hitch we're participating in is just the second blasting session in a much larger effort. At the end of five years, the team will have removed 80 of the 89 culverts left by loggers, and three bridges, Dean says.\\n“We're restoring habitat, improving hydrologic function and strengthening the land's resilience. After that, it's hands off,” she says, releasing the Pulaski to underline the point.\\nUp ahead, a reddish-brown haze settles over the blast site. The crew gathers along the banks and stares into a triangular trench where the culvert once ran.\\nSean Rielly, a former wilderness ranger and forest service recreation specialist, slaloms down the mud and begins removing shards of the shattered culvert. Daniels and his crew follow, pushing boulders out of the new streambed. Suddenly, the goop of mud and alder leaves releases, flooding downhill. After an hour of work, a small mountain stream flows freely.\\n“Now,” Dean says, “we watch for fish.”\\nThe fish are anadromous, she explains – a fancy word that means being born in freshwater, living in saltwater, then returning to freshwater to lay and fertilize eggs. Their decaying bodies provide food for the carnivorous spruce, hemlock and cedar trees in a healthy stand of old growth. The salmon also sustain the brown bears prowling the island, their coats glossy with salmon oil, their humps shifting as they patrol the rivers, waiting for the salmon to arrive.\\nThe Cube Cove project reaches its midpoint at a moment when the Trump administration renews logging efforts in the Tongass. In June, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to remove the Roadless Rule protections, exposing 7m acres of the Tongass to extensive clearcuts. Ecologists warn that cutting much of the old growth could release massive amounts of carbon stored in the trees.\\nIn fact, Dean says, when federal funding dried up, Cube Cove progress stalled. Luckily, SAWC was able to use wetlands mitigation money from the state of Alaska to account for the shortfall.\\n“It's unfortunate, what's happening. The region is just now starting to recover from the violence of clearcutting,” says Rob Cadmus, director of SAWC. “At Cube Cove, what we're doing essentially is cleaning up the mess left from logging. Going back to those timber bonanza days would be unconscionable, from an economic, environmental and psychic standpoint.”\\nFederal subsidies have long made old-growth logging in the Tongass artificially profitable. By selling timber below market value and covering high costs like road building and transportation, the government incentivizes larger logging companies from the lower 48 to cut down trees, despite the fact that south-east Alaska's economy is shifting toward eco-tourism and fishing – industries that depend on preserving the Tongass intact, rather than transforming the mountains into a moonscape, with no habitat left for salmon to spawn.\\nAs the crew works with hand tools, Dean inspects the flow of water, while Greenhalgh examines the composition of dirt. The two assess whether a second “cleanup shot” of explosives might be necessary before abandoning the site. Hand tools can take care of the rest, they decide.\\nAs the sun sets over the mouth of the valley, the group begins a 3.5-mile hike along the logging road back to the ATVs and forest service truck. Along the way, Daniels nods toward an alternating series of oven-mitt-shaped prints in the ground – evidence of the island's apex predators.\\n“Bear have survived here for thousands of years,” he says. “And so have we. All of that makes what's happening today feel really personal.”\\nRielly catches up and talks about all the time he spent behind a desk justifying the need for mechanized equipment and explosives and the minimum tool necessary to help the region's recovery. In 2024, a youth group from Angoon removed a culvert barely beneath the ground using only standard forest service hand tools: Pulaskis, shovels, mattocks and rakes.\\nThe effort took seven days.\\n“If we don't do this work, the land will continue to degrade. Culverts clog, landslides are triggered, watersheds are blocked,” Rielly says. “This is the only way to get the job done quickly, especially in such remote terrain.”\\nThrough the scrim of spruce saplings, stumps of ancient old-growth loom: cedar, hemlock and spruce recorded at more than 1,000 years old. The group crosses the Ward Creek bridge, held in place by steel girders 8ft wide covered by creosote timbers. These will be removed at the end of the project, when the crew erases their footprints. On the other side of the bridge, Daniels, Washington and Williams hop on the ATVs, while the rest of the group pile into the truck for the 12-mile trip back to camp.\\nAfter showers in the ocean, the group congregates around a driftwood bonfire on the beach, where thousands of logs were once dumped and rafted together, on the way to the mill. Dean sips from a can of lime sparkling water – a treat in the remote area. Dressed now in flannel pajamas, Washington perches on a rock. He describes his work in the forest as engaging in a cycle of “destruction and renewal”.\\n“The land will heal itself if left alone,” he says. “But sometimes you have to set a bone before it can heal properly. I know that this hard work we're doing out here is for my children, and for their children down the line.”\\n“What you're seeing here is a version of the next generation of conservation – partnerships that connect people, place and purpose,” Cadmus of SAWC says. “When we're out here working side by side, we build a bond that's stronger than words. At the end of the day, that's what heals us. We're all in service to the land.”\\n• This article was amended on 18 August 2025 because an earlier version described anadromous fish as those that spawn and then die. In fact anadromous means being born in freshwater, living in saltwater, then returning to freshwater to lay and fertilize eggs. Also, the culverts are made from galvanized steel, not aluminum.\"]"

         "[\"The French prime minister, François Bayrou, has surprised France by calling a sudden confidence vote on 8 September, saying he needs backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.\\nBayrou is almost certain to lose the gamble. All opposition parties from the far right to the left have said they will vote to topple the prime minister and his minority government after only nine months in office.\\nThis would create a fresh political crisis. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, would have to decide whether to swiftly choose a replacement prime minister, while any new appointee could face the same difficulties as Bayrou in securing support.\\nMacron could instead call a snap parliamentary election, but he recently said he was reluctant to do so. Last year's snap election resulted in a divided parliament where no political grouping has an outright majority.\\nBayrou, a centrist and long-term Macron ally, was struggling to get support for his unpopular plan for a €44bn budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France's public debt. His proposals, including scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, were contested across the political class.\\nBayrou knew he was facing a difficult autumn: he would have to force through the 2026 budget without a parliament vote and was likely to be toppled by a no-confidence motion in the coming months. Calling his own confidence vote on 8 September was a way of jumping before he was pushed. He is the least popular prime minister since 1958, with one poll this summer showing 80% of French people did not trust him. \\nBayrou was also braced for anti-government demonstrations and strikes on 10 September against his budget plans, which officials feared might grow to resemble the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protest movement of 2018 and 2019. \\nIf Bayrou falls, the most likely scenario is Macron chooses another prime minister. But it is not certain who, and they may have the same difficulties as Bayrou and struggle to pass a 2026 budget. \\nOne year ago, Macron appointed the rightwing Michel Barnier as prime minister, but parliament ousted him only three months later over budget disagreements. His replacement, Bayrou, will have lasted nine months by the time of the vote.\\nSince Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance won the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron's centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre. \\nThe Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said this week that Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. But the rightwing party Les Républicains, which has propped up the current government, would oppose that.\\nNames that have previously circulated as potential prime ministers include the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was on the right before joining Macron's centrists, and the former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\\nMacron gambled on a snap parliamentary election last summer in an attempt to head off the far right and bolster his authority, but the move backfired and parliament was left deadlocked. Macron told Paris Match earlier this month that he did not intend to hold another snap election.\\nThe justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said this week that a snap election could not be ruled out. Some members of Macron's centrist camp believe calling a parliamentary election may be the only solution, while others are opposed.\\nMarine Le Pen is pushing for a snap election in the hope that her far-right National Rally party could gain seats. In last year's snap election, the far right gained ground but was held back in the final round by tactical voting and a left alliance. If an election is called, it is likely that Macron's centrist grouping would lose seats.\\nA majority of French people want parliament to be dissolved and a fresh parliamentary election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive.\\nMacron's second term as president runs until spring 2027 and he has always ruled out resigning. There were calls this week from some on the left, right and far right for Macron to resign but this is not expected.\\nIf Bayrou is ousted, the current French government would stay in place in a temporary, caretaker capacity to run domestic affairs until a new government is formed. This means policies on small boats would continue, including French policing of the northern coast, where people are departing for the UK. \\nKeir Starmer announced a “one in, one out” returns deal with France earlier this year whereby the UK would send some people arriving by small boat back to France in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain. That will continue. \\nFrench maritime authorities are continuing to study the possibility of a legal extension of French policing powers to the shallow waters off northern beaches, to prevent boats from departing.\", \"France is braced for another political crisis as the minority government of François Bayrou appears almost certain to be toppled in a confidence vote next month, amid deep political divisions over an unpopular austerity budget and debt-reduction plan.\\n“I will fight like a dog,” the centrist prime minister told L'Express on Tuesday after his surprise decision to call a vote of confidence from parliamentarians.\\nBayrou, 74, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, is expected to lose the vote as opposition parties on the far right and left said they would relish the opportunity to eject him after less than nine months in office.\\nBoris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliamentary group, told BFM TV: “We need to change politics and for that we need to change prime minister.” \\nBayrou's gamble – which involves Macron convening a special session of parliament on 8 September for a confidence vote that the prime minister has almost no chance of winning – has sparked fears of another political crisis less than a year after the previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over budget disagreements after only three months.\\nThe Paris stock market tumbled, shares in French banks sank and the country's borrowing costs rose on Tuesday as investors fretted.\\nA planned protest movement against Bayrou's proposed budget cuts, which gathered support on social media over the summer, as well as potential strikes and demonstrations by trade unions are expected to begin on 10 September, regardless of whether Bayrou is forced to quit.\\nThe beleaguered politician attended a meeting of the CFDT trade union on Tuesday where he urged French political parties to think carefully about the vote, noting they had 13 days to “say whether they are on the side of chaos or responsibility”.\\nBayrou said: “Is there or is there not a national emergency to rebalance the accounts, to escape excessive debt by choosing to reduce our deficits and produce more? That is the central question.”\\nIn what was seen as a last-minute appeal to the left, he said he was prepared to demand a “specific effort” from high-wealth individuals, after his budget proposals were widely criticised for affecting poor people and pensioners while having less impact on the very wealthy.\\nIf Bayrou is ousted, Macron would be dragged into domestic upheaval at a significant international moment for him, as he positions himself to play a role on Ukraine and the recognition of a Palestinian state.\\nUnder the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs. Macron could swiftly appoint a new prime minister but they too could risk being ousted over the budget.\\nA source close to the far-right leader Marine Le Pen told Reuters it was hard to see how any new prime minister could escape being hit by a vote of no confidence.\\nLe Pen's party instead wants Macron to dissolve parliament and call a snap election. Macron said this summer he did not want to do this, but the justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Tuesday that an election could not be ruled out.\\nSince Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance took the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron's centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre. The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left.\\nThe interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, who leads the rightwing Les Républicains party that has propped up Bayrou, said it would be irresponsible and “against France's interests” to vote for the government to fall.\\nAt the heart of the crisis is Bayrou's unpopular and vague plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France's public debt. This includes scrapping two public holidays and freezing welfare spending and tax brackets. Hospital staff are concerned about deep cuts to the public health service.\\nPolls show voters on all political sides see the budget as unfair and letting the wealthiest off the hook. This summer, Bayrou became the least popular French prime minister since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, with one poll showing 80% of French people did not trust him.\\n• This article was amended on 27 August 2025. The left alliance took the largest number of seats in the 2024 French legislative election, not the most votes as an earlier version said.\", \"Good morning. France has bid adieu to its fourth prime minister in just over three years.\\nFrançois Bayrou, a 74-year-old tractor-driving centrist (who claimed to be a great consensus-builder), has been ousted after just nine months on the job for failing to do the thing he promised: find agreement in the French parliament.\\nThe vacancy is a poisoned chalice as there's every chance Bayrou's successor will also get shuffled off. This is because France's politicians cannot agree on how to tackle spiralling state deficits and debts. Underpinning it all is growing anger among voters who feel their quality of life is deteriorating, and that politicians are doing nothing about it.\\nIn the past 60 years of the Fifth Republic, France has never seen such political gridlock. For today's newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian's Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, about why France can't find a stable government and what could happen next. That's after the headlines.\\nPolitics | A trove of leaked data from Boris Johnson's private office reveals how the former prime minister has been profiting from influence he gained in office in a possible breach of ethics and lobbying rules. The files reveal Johnson lobbied a senior Saudi official he had met while in office and received more than £200,000 from a hedge fund after meeting Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro.\\nUK news | A series of senior female Labour MPs have dropped out of contention to replace Angela Rayner as the party's deputy leader, as a compressed timetable for nominations and worries about a potentially toxic atmosphere narrowed the field.\\nUS news | House Democrats released an image of a sexually suggestive letter and drawing that appears to bear the signature of Donald Trump, the very same note the president had denied writing after reports of its existence were published earlier this year.\\nFilm | Hundreds of film industry figures, including Olivia Colman, Mark Ruffalo and Ava DuVernay, have pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.\\nNepal | At least 19 people have been killed during protests in Nepal over a government ban on dozens of social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and X.\\nSince president Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election last year, there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly – a hung parliament, impossibly divided by their political imperatives.\\nIt is divided into three blocs – the left, centre and far right – which has made France nearly ungovernable. Unlike Germany, postwar France doesn't have the tradition of building coalition governments; rather than finding consensus, they have found themselves in crisis, and these divisions have shown up most when it comes to public spending.\\nBayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. The primary reason for his fall was his unpopular budget, which involved scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending. France faces acute pressure to repair its finances. Bayrou said his €44bn (£38bn) debt-reduction plan was needed because France's deficit hit 5.8% of gross domestic product last year – way above the official EU limit of 3%.\\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at €3.346tn, or 114% of GDP. Bayrou told the public that young people would be saddled with years of debt repayments “for the sake of the comfort of the boomers” if they failed to take action.\\nBayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation. “Part of Bayrou's problem was that he decided that he was going to be this great ‘truth-sayer' about the state of France's public finances. He said ‘look, we are collapsing under the weight of debt'. The public knows there hasn't been a balanced budget in France for several decades. Voters have this as one of their key concerns,” said Angelique Chrisafis.\\nHowever, in all his many TV interviews, he kept hammering home what a big problem debt is, while avoiding talking about who was responsible for it. Opposition parties want Macron to reflect on the impact his policies have had on public debt – notably his choice of pro-business economics in which taxes are cut for businesses and the very wealthy, which the left says has partially led the country into this mess, explains Angelique. “We're left in this position where parties can't agree on what went wrong,” she said.\\n“Macron's difficulty is that he is clinging desperately to his own economic approach, his pro-business stance of cutting the tax burden on businesses, which he says increases growth and productivity. But growth has not been as much as was expected.”\\nThe office of the French president said he would make a decision on the next prime minister “in the coming days”.\\n***\\nDeeper political crisis\\nUnderlying this is the deepening mistrust between people and their politicians (sound familiar?) that is likely to blight the country's politics until the 2027 presidential election and beyond.\\n“There is a sense of great disappointment that legislation, parliament and politics has not been addressing people's worries about the cost of living, about the state of public services. Many people who work in hospitals and the health system say they've faced years of cuts, which are making their jobs very difficult,” Angelique said.\\nResearch has shown poverty in France is increasing, with growing concentrations of inherited wealth sparking comparisons to the 19th century. Marion Carrel, sociology professor at the University of Lille, said there was a feeling of “the little people versus the big”, which gave a “pre-revolutionary” atmosphere.\\nNational Rally – the biggest single party in terms of votes in the National Assembly – is trying to capitalise on the instability to make electoral gains. “The far right is using this crisis to try and say, ‘Well, look, people always thought we weren't experienced enough to be in power, or that we'd bring some kind of chaos, but look at the instability now',” said Angelique. “Certainly the far right is a force to be reckoned with, and will continue to be up until the presidential election.”\\nAs France is the eurozone's second-biggest economy, this deadlock has implications for Europe as it is desperately trying to find unity in the face of three era-defining challenges: the war in Ukraine, trade tensions with the US, and the increasing dominance of China.\\n***\\nWhy can't France find a stable government?\\nThe centrist Macron is now tasked with appointing his third prime minister in a year, and the fifth since he took office in 2022. There is no obvious consensus figure to replace Bayrou.\\nMacron's protege Gabriel Attal left in September 2024 after he stayed on a caretaker role following last year's inconclusive snap election. Former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier followed him, but was toppled by a no-confidence vote in December, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern republic.\\nFrance is so divided politically that any new choice of prime minister could quite easily face a quick challenge – they will encounter deadlock in parliament, and find it impossible to push through a budget.\\n“We're in this great political fighting pit ahead of the local elections next spring 2026 and presidential in 2027. There is really no move for people to cooperate among this fragmented parliament,” said Angelique. “Macron now begins this strange period of trying to do the arithmetic to see whether there could be any kind of pact with other parties.”\\nMacron has said he'll stay in government until the end of his term, but is a lame duck if this political paralysis continues. A poll for Le Figaro magazine found just 15% of French people trust Macron to solve the crisis.\\nThe National Rally party are easily ahead in the polls, but probably wouldn't get an absolute majority, because there are many voters in France who would vote tactically to hold them back. “If we were to have a snap election right now, it could return exactly the same results currently in parliament,” said Angelique.\\n***\\nHow will the public respond?\\nNever shy to take to the streets, French people are expected to protest next week, in a movement known as Block Everything. This is likely to involve street demonstrations followed by union-led hospital and rail strikes. This could awake memories of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) – which led the anti-government protest movement in 2018 as well as the separate protest movement in 2023 against Macron's increase to the pension age.\\n“There's a lot of anger among people who are planning protests across France, whether it will be blockading shops or roads or roundabouts or protesting in the streets, and that is reflective of a great distrust between people in France and their politicians,” said Angelique.\\nMacron will be under pressure to find a new prime minister quickly to end uncertainty. “The pressure is on to try to convince its voters, its businesses and its international partners that it's stable, that it's not falling into an unsolvable moment of political crisis.”\\nI was moved by this piece on how we distract ourselves with screens and busyness, but as psychotherapist Moya Sarner argues, transformation comes only by diving deep into the pain holding us back.

         "[\"The Reform party's promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country's most senior chief constables has said.\\nSerena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge.\\nShe led its response to the Southport dance class murders last year, the riots that followed and led the way on giving ethnicity and nationality details of suspects, to counter disinformation.\\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Kennedy said the riots in Southport started with “carloads” of people arriving to attack a mosque, and dismissed claims that asylum seekers were to blame for a crime wave.\\nShe also called for a new national scheme to counter violence, and criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer's Southport riot.\\nReform UK, which recently won local councils and is predicted to win more in elections next May, is vowing to scrap what it calls DEI initiatives – the term used by Donald Trump supporters – on diversity, equity and inclusion.\\nKennedy said: “I have a real nervousness that we are going backwards in relation to diversity and equality.”\\nShe said those groups with less confidence in policing and other public services, such as ethnic minorities and women, needed efforts by key institutions such as the police to win their trust back.\\nKennedy said: “Is it acceptable for policing and the public sector to stop worrying about those people where there is a confidence gap and say, well that's just tough, and we'll let that confidence gap get even wider? … Absolutely not. That's why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.\\n“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally' – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don't.\\n“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.\\n“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”\\nKennedy's retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.\\nShe said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened: “Seeing the disorder that's out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.\\n“So I do think we're on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”\\nThe toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.\\nThe next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by riots that spread across the country and were the worst in more than a decade.\\nKennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”\\nKennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.\\nIn the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.\\nThe chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.\\nShe pointed to this May's incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.\\nKennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we'd put out didn't suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”\\nShe said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authorities might be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn't in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”\\nKennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”\\nShe dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I'm not seeing anything out of kilter … It's just, it's more newsworthy.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is really important frankly that people support our police rather than just attacking them continually.\\n“As we have seen, Reform is one day calling for chief constables to resign, the next it is attacking women police officers who are out on our streets every single day of the week.”\\nFarage has repeatedly weighed into the debate about the Epping migrant hotel and said this week: “Hard-left groups, Stand Up to Racism and Antifa, were given the red carpet treatment by Essex police, with the force literally escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest. They have been caught red-handed helping to light the fuse that led to violence.”\\nHarrington said Reform's claims were “categorically wrong” and that officers had organised a cordon around activists exercising their right to protest.\\nDal Babu, a former chief superintendent for the Metropolitan police, said Farage's claims were wrong and he should correct the public record amid rising tensions.\\n“British values mean if a politician makes a mistake, they put their hand up and acknowledge it. He knows it is false,” Babu said.\\nOn Thursday, Epping Forest district council unanimously voted to support a motion calling for the immediate closure of the Bell hotel for the purpose of asylum processing and for the “managed closure” of the Phoenix hotel. The vote was non-binding and purely symbolic.\\nDuring the meeting Chris Whitbread, the leader of the council, reiterated that the local authority had no say on the use of the hotels and the decision was up to the Home Office, who he accused of “not being overly cooperative” when safeguarding concerns were raised.\\nHundreds of protesters, including many women and children, began marching from Epping town centre to the hotel at about 6pm in heavy rain. A ramped-up police operation included fences and a ban on the wearing of facial coverings.\\nAn 18-year-old man was arrested for breaching a section 60AA order, which prevents anyone wearing a face covering.\\nPolice have arrested 17 people in total over protests in Epping.\\nActivists from the far-right Homeland group were behind an Epping Says No! Facebook group that has been behind much of the promotion of the protests. Members of Patriotic Alternative and White Vanguard have also been involved.\\nWhile politicians have largely stayed away from the protest, two Reform councillors were present outside the Epping hotel last week, including James Regan who claimed in an interview that “they're trying to dilute the Englishness out of us”.\\nThe Guardian also found evidence that a Reform official shared a platform in Epping with an agitator from Homeland.\\nIn last year's summer riots, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, called out “far-right thuggery” and pledged to bring those involved to justice.\\nHowever, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Thursday that many of the Epping protesters were “upset for legitimate reasons”.\\nAngela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, told the cabinet earlier this week that immigration and deprivation were among the main factors causing public disenchantment with politicians.\\nThere is already a taskforce on community cohesion, informed by experts and officials, while a £1.5bn “plan for neighbourhoods” aims to invest in 75 deprived areas over the next decade.\\nSome Labour MPs are concerned that political and media language about the UK being on the brink of social unrest may be raising tensions rather than encouraging cohesion.\\nStella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said on Thursday that if people were “unsettled by the political and press debate around immigration, law and order, the idea that there could be race riots again, you are completely right to be concerned because this discussion in itself is raising fear and uncertainty and tension”.\\nShe added: “It is dividing us and feeding this myth that Britain is a nation that cannot manage diversity rather than one that draws strength from it.”\\nBrendan Cox, whose wife, Jo, a Labour MP, was murdered by a far-right extremist, said the UK needed a longer-term strategy on social cohesion.\\n“There is a set of local concerns around this in Epping and it's also true that these are being co-opted and used by elements of the far right,” said Cox, who is the convener of an independent commission on community.\\n“It's no surprise that happens when there are these kind of festering legitimate concerns and successive governments are seen to not act on those.\\n“But the broad point I'd make is that we've published a report about there being a tinderbox … and I think what's really clear is that we don't really have any long-term cohesion strategy at all.”\\nNick Lowles, of the Hope not Hate campaign group, said: “We are concerned that policing has not caught up with the new post-organisation nature of the far right, where individuals can emerge and play a role on social media and inciting or directing violence, without ever being a member of a far-right organisation.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court and will stand trial next month.\\nA Reform official would not answer questions about sharing a platform with the far right or about Cooper's claims that the party should back the police.\\nInstead the spokesperson said the Guardian “cares more about attacking Reform UK than defending young girls who are being abused by illegal boat migrants”.\", \"Shabana Mahmood knows what it is like to live in an area where crime feels out of control. While she was growing up in Small Heath in inner-city Birmingham in the 1980s and 90s, her father kept a cricket bat behind the till of the family shop to fend off would-be robbers.\\nThree decades later, Mahmood is Labour's justice secretary and lord chancellor, tasked with cutting crime at a time when public concern about it is rising.\\nThough violent crime has fallen steadily over decades, recent increases in highly visible offences including shoplifting and snatch theft have contributed to a feeling of lawlessness and insecurity.\\nFanning the flames are politicians including Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and Robert Jenrick, Mahmood's Conservative counterpart, who have sought to draw a link between crime – particularly sexual assault – and immigration.\\nFor Mahmood, being the daughter of immigrants is central to her worldview about justice. “She feels very strongly that being British is a responsibility as well as a right,” a source close to her said. “She really does feel like it's an affront when people who come here are afforded the welcome that she and her family were, but break the laws of the land.”\\nAnother politician shaped by his upbringing as the child of immigrant parents was Rishi Sunak, who felt strongly that it was an injustice for people to arrive illegally in Britain on small boats. Though their backgrounds and politics are very different, Mahmood and Sunak crossed paths at Oxford in the late 90s, with a teenage Sunak pledging his support for Mahmood when she stood for president of the Lincoln college student union.\\nLast week, she received the surprise endorsement of another high-profile Tory: Michael Gove. Asked by the Politics Inside Out podcast to choose this government's standout figure, he replied without hesitation: Shabana Mahmood. Mahmood is a politician with “a totally coherent worldview” who “embodies in some respects the Labour coalition”, he said.\\nMahmood has a growing number of admirers inside the Labour party, too. Having been a central figure in the Keir Starmer project from its early days, she is highly rated by No 10 and is thought of as one of its most effective ministers. A cabinet colleague said she “never wastes a word” in meetings, and recently warned that the government was still caught up in an opposition mindset and preoccupied with taking on the left instead of speaking to the concerns of the country more widely. She has also been a leading advocate for the UK to take a more pro-Palestinian stance, including on statehood.\\nThose who have worked with Mahmood praise her political nous. This year, she emerged unscathed from a clash with Jenrick over new sentencing guidelines that would have made an offender's ethnicity or faith a greater factor when deciding whether to jail them. She forced the Sentencing Council to back down and has ordered a review of its role.\\nEarly on, she also clashed with Richard Hermer, the attorney general, amid claims he was obstructing aspects of the government's agenda. Colleagues say the pair get on well personally but come from different traditions. “Shabana believes, above all else, in parliamentary sovereignty and the value of our common law system. That makes her more of a reformer on things like the ECHR, [European convention on human rights]” a source close to her said. A former Conservative minister said: “She has much better political antennae than Lord Hermer – she recognises that the law ultimately has to command public confidence.”\\nOne source who has worked with her in a previous role said: “Her instincts are so well honed, it's quite something. It's a product of a number of things, she comes from a very political family and a very febrile political environment in Birmingham.” Her father was chair of the Birmingham Labour party and would host meetings for organisers – including Tom Watson, the future deputy Labour leader – in his living room over tea and samosas.\\nUnusually among politicians, she has spoken about the importance of her faith. “It is the absolute core of my life,” she told Gove in an interview with the Spectator. “It's where I draw my sense of duty and public service from. My understanding of Islam, how I've practised Islam my whole life has been about viewing life as a gift from God but it's also a test from God.”\\n“She is a very defined politician with a real instinct for the times,” said Charlie Falconer, who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair. “She is somebody who does understand politics in a profound way, and having been the campaign coordinator for Labour for quite some time she knows what has to be done in order to win elections.”\\nMahmood was elected to parliament in 2010 and within six months was promoted to a shadow frontbench role. In Starmer's shadow cabinet, she spent more than two years as national campaign coordinator, a role in which she became indispensable to the strategy chief, Morgan McSweeney. She is credited for helping secure the narrow but fateful win in the 2021 Batley and Spen byelection, without which Starmer would probably have faced a leadership challenge that summer.\\nIn the justice department, she has arguably inherited the most difficult situation of any minister. In her first week, she announced the early release of thousands of criminals in response to the overcrowding crisis in English and Welsh prisons. “She knows she has got two things she has got to do in the justice department: get it out of this constant cycle of crisis and also use it to actually cut crime,” said the source close to her.\\nShe has set out plans for reforming the criminal justice system, which have ranged from chemical castration for serious sex offenders to allowing criminals to spend less time in prison and instead be rehabilitated in the community. She has taken inspiration from Texas, where there is a blend of hardline and progressive measures. “She's not bowed down by an ideological approach to these things. She can blend some populism in with what are very strong values,” said the person who worked with her in the past.\\nMahmood's experience of government so far has convinced her of the need to rewire the state and empower elected politicians over officials and quangos. “Shabana is starting to be seen particularly as a leader of ‘if we need to break things, we should break things' … She has come to really believe in the depths of state failure,” one MP close to her said. In a speech in Strasbourg this summer, she announced that the UK would seek reform of the European convention on human rights amid concerns about it being cited to block the deportation of dangerous offenders.\\nThe justice secretary has a busy autumn in store, starting with plans to introduce a bill in September to deliver her sentencing reforms including shorter prison sentences for some offenders. Before the end of the year, she intends to set out the other half of her reform agenda to tackle the groaning backlog in crown courts, after a review by Brian Leveson recommended that some offences be tried without a jury.\\nHowever she performs in government, by the time of the next election Mahmood may face her biggest challenge at home. Her majority in Birmingham Ladywood dropped from nearly 30,000 in 2019 to 3,400 last year after a challenge from a pro-Gaza independent candidate. Zarah Sultana, the independent MP who is starting a party with Jeremy Corbyn, is said to have designs on the seat.\\nAllies of Mahmood say that her challengers face an uphill struggle. “She is much more deeply embedded in her community than others who lost or came close to losing were,” the source close to her said.\\nIn parliament in recent months, Mahmood has hosted dinners with small groups of Labour MPs interested in the reforms she is planning.\\nSome on the backbenches have begun to see her as a future leader. “If she ever put the hat in the ring, it would be because she wanted the debate to be rigorous and bold and she wanted to be the person who forced that kind of honesty,” the MP close to her said. “But it tends to be the case that the people who propagate that kind of message don't win.”\"]"

Anyone who works in security will also pick up on how they were standing. If you looked you could see they held their hands together to give a discreet thumbs up sign,” said the man, reluctant like so many other local people to go on the record, but who gave his name as “Steve Davis”.\\nThe only problem with this analysis was: it appeared to be entirely wrong.\\nEssex police has “categorically” denied it bussed in antiracism protesters. The suggestion of state-sponsored “false flag” provocateurs – a frequent trope advanced on niche corners of social media at times of tensions on the streets – was also dismissed.\\nThe denials have often come too late to stop the conspiracies taking hold. They have been eagerly spread by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, and also carried on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.\\nDisinformation has been one of the most alarming characteristics of the violent protests in Epping, whose focus has been the use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers.\\nLocal people have continued to turn out for the protests, which were sparked after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault – but far-right activists have played a key role in promoting them online. Activists from groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present.\\nOnline misinformation and disinformation originating on niche corners of X has been amplified – seemingly without attempt to corroborate whether it is true – by politicians such as Farage and commenters from the GB News channel.\\nVideo clips of Stand Up to Racism protesters being taken out of Epping last Thursday in police vans, after they were surrounded by groups of men who threw projectiles at them and the police, were quickly repurposed on social media – and presented as if they were images of protesters being transported from Epping station.\\nIn fact, as Essex police has confirmed, the Stand Up to Racism protesters had made their way on foot from the station earlier in the day, while police escorted them on foot to enable them to exercise a right to protest.\\nBy Friday, however, rightwing commenters such as the ex-GB News presenter Dan Wootton were also misrepresenting the footage. “They actually escorted people in police vans,” Wootton told the viewers of the online show he set up after leaving GB News.\\nOn Wednesday, Farage posted the same footage on X, saying: “This video proves [police] transported leftwing protesters to the Bell hotel in Epping” and calling for the resignation of the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington.\\nThe force issued a statement saying this was categorically untrue, while Harrington made pointed comments in a press conference where he urged commenters to be responsible for what they said online, adding that it had “real-world consequences”.\\nFarage modulated his language after he was contacted on Wednesday, saying the police were “escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest”, but his original tweet remains on X.\\nLater on Thursday, and in a tweet shortly after 10pm on Wednesday, Farage went on GB News to say he had received a call from a police officer who was in charge of the operation to say he was wrong. “If I was slightly out on accuracy I apologise but I think the gist of what I was saying was right,” he said.\\nBy then, however, the misinformation had spread like wildfire and done “real damage”, according to Lewis Nielsen of Stand Up to Racism.\\n“It is a complete lie to say, as Farage has claimed, that Stand Up to Racism protesters were ‘bussed in'. We are mobilising antiracists, trade unionists, campaigners and faith groups against the far right in Epping,” he said.\\nYet more conspiracies – some outlandish, others more minor but corrosive – continue to circulate.

It was among conspiracy theories being disseminated in online spaces including the Epping Says No! Facebook group, which has more than 1,600 members. Its administrators include activists from the far-right Homeland party, Adam Clegg and Callum Barker.\\nThe claims of undercover police officers being among the antiracism protesters have been accompanied by clips and pictures zeroing in on pictures of some of those protesters.\\nThe claims were also denied by Essex police, which has been trying to combat what it calls “myths” in videos fronted by an assistant chief constable. The force specifically picked out the claim that there were “police decoys in the crowd encouraging violence”, rebutting it on its YouTube channel.\\nNielsen also denied the claim: “It is categorically false that the police are involved in Stand Up to Racism protests, or play any role in organising them. If anything our protests – like others – have faced police repression in recent years.”\", \"Hundreds of people gathered outside a hotel in Epping on Sunday for the fifth time to demonstrate over the premises being used to house asylum seekers, as protests spread to other hotels over the weekend.\\nA large police presence containing officers from multiple forces restricted contact between anti- and pro-immigrant protesters, with Essex police saying restrictions were necessary after what it described as repeated serious disruption, violence and harm to the community since the first demonstration took place on 13 July.\\nTwo men were charged with public order offences after a protest of about 400 anti-immigration and 250 counter-protesters outside a hotel in Diss on Saturday, Norfolk constabulary said. There was a further protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf in London on Sunday, with the number of protesters appearing to be in the low hundreds.\\nThe demonstration in Epping in Essex on Sunday – where as many as 500 anti-immigrant protesters gathered behind metal barriers outside the Bell hotel – was the latest in a series of protests that began after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault for allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and is in custody.\\nProtesters wore T-shirts and held up signs bearing the slogan “protect our kids”, while others waved England flags. Other flags seen included one for Reform UK, and a white flag with a red cross on a blue square, as seen in the US at anti-abortion demonstrations.\\nCounter-protesters held banners including one that read “Don't let the far right divide us with their hatred and violence”, and “Care for refugees”. They chanted “Refugees are welcome here” and “Nazi scum off our streets”.\\nPolice said three people were arrested during the peaceful protest, two from the anti-hotel protest group and the other from the counter-protest group. “I want to thank those who attended for the peaceful nature of both protests,” said Ch Supt Simon Anslow of Essex police. “I am pleased that today has passed off without incident and I am grateful to our colleagues from other forces for their support.”\\nIn a letter sent to the Guardian, asylum seekers said “harmful stereotypes” about refugees did not reflect the truth. “There are some refugees who do not behave respectfully or who do not follow the rules of the host society. But those individuals do not represent all of us,” they said. “As with any group of people, there are both good and bad – and it is unfair to judge the majority by the actions of a few.”\\nThe letter mentioned fleeing persecution and violence. “We refugees are not here to take advantage of the system. We are here to rebuild our lives, to work, and to contribute,” they wrote, adding: “This letter is not a plea for sympathy, but a call for understanding and fairness.”\\nOutside the Bell hotel, one local woman, who did not want to be named, said residents had complained about an increase in antisocial incidents since it began housing asylum seekers but felt ignored and unfairly labelled as “far right”.\\n“I'm not saying everyone in any of these hotels is up to no good. I'm not going to judge everyone, but there is no vetting,” she said. “We won't stop until they start listening and shut this hotel down.”\\nActivists from far-right groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present at previous protests. On Sunday Kai Stephens, the Norfolk branch organiser for Homeland, held a sign that said: “Put local people first.”\\nStephens said: “Unfortunately, there has to be a certain point where we turn around and say, the British people should be put first, the indigenous British people.”\\nSupporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson were also present. Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had said he would attend before changing his mind and saying it would not be helpful to protesters.\\nOther local protesters said far-right agitators were not welcome. “It's 100% unhelpful, because it just gives them a message which is not what we're trying to achieve here,” said one man, who did not want to be named.\\nStand Up to Racism, the group that organised the counter-protest, estimated about 700 people had gone to Epping. Lewis Nielsen, an officer at Stand Up to Racism, said Nigel Farage's Reform UK had emboldened the far right.\\n“It's a really dangerous situation at the moment because you haven't just got the protest here, you've got other protests coming up around the country,” Nielsen said. “We stopped the riots last August with these kinds of mobilisations, and that's why we're pleased the one today has been successful.”\\nOne protester, Joshua Bailey, who said he grew up in Epping, said increasing anti-immigration sentiment had made people of colour in his friend group feel vulnerable and threatened. “It's very important that we have a positive stance towards refugees, who are people fleeing genuine tragedy and disaster.”\\nHe said he did not agree with chants that labelled protesters as fascists or Nazis. “There is room for nuance,” he said. “I'd like to be able to sit down in a pub with someone who had opposing views and be able to speak about it.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The group said it had a major mobilisation in Islington, facing about 10 on the other side.\\nOne senior officer in an area expecting a protest said: “It is impossible to tell what you are going to get. Within crowds you can get different factions, concerned locals, bystanders, extremists.”\\nOfficers will need to keep both sides apart as well as ensure disruption is kept to a minimum.\\nThe 3,000 riot officers have been requested from local forces and will be directed by the National Police Coordination Centre.\\nLocal commanders will make decisions about specific deployments. In some areas public order officers may deploy in full riot gear from the start to act as a deterrent. Other forces will prefer to have officers in regular uniforms, so called “soft hats”, to start with, with fully kitted riot officers in reserve and close by if trouble erupts.\\nThe far right is involved in some, if not most, of the protests but those attending are expected to include local people concerned by claims linking asylum seeker hotels to serious crime.\\nPolice public order resources this weekend face a pincer movement from right and left.\\nThe Metropolitan police is calling in support from other forces as it faces three days of substantial public order challenges, including an anti-migrant protest in Islington, north London, on Friday night, with more are expected at another in Canary Wharf on Sunday.\\nOn Saturday in central London there will be a pro-Palestine march, along with a protest encouraging supporters of Palestine Action – and opponents of its ban under terrorism laws – to dare police to arrest them.\\nOrganisers and police sources agree privately hundreds are likely to turn up, the range likely to be 200 to just under 1,000, encouraged to hold placards containing the words “I support Palestine Action”, which police say will lead to arrest.\\nOrganisers hope to stretch to breaking point the police and criminal justice system's ability to deal with a mass defiance. Police believe they will manage unless the numbers exceed expectations.\\nIn London, small groups of protesters started to gather from about 5pm on Friday across the road from the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf. Riot police scrambled to keep groups of masked men who broke away from the anti-asylum seeker protest from reaching a separate group of anti-racism activists who had attempted to walk down to the hotel.\\nAbout 200 anti-migrant protesters – including men waving St George's flags and an Israeli flag – had gathered across the road from the hotel, with some hurling abuse at a Stand Up to Racism protest of about 100 activists, trade unionists and others.\\nPolice kept a distance but vans with public order officers were also stationed in streets nearby. Two people were arrested.\\nOn Sunday in London, there will be a march in support of the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attack, as well as football's Community Shield match. The start of football's lower divisions this weekend will also require police resources.\\nMetropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan, who will lead the policing operation, warned people who want to protest against the banning of Palestine Action that they should expect a terrorism charge.\\nShe said: “Anyone showing support for Palestine Action can expect to be arrested. An arrest under the Terrorism Act can have very real long-term implications – from travel, to employment, to finances.”\\nThere was some unease in Nuneaton on Friday afternoon, before what is expected to be a big turnout at a protest outside the council building on Saturday.\\nThe Warwickshire town has become a target for far-right activists in recent days, after two Afghan men were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old girl. They have now been charged in relation to the alleged incident.\\nThe Reform UK council leader, 19-year-old George Finch, accused the police of covering up the claim that the men, Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir, are asylum seekers.\\nA group of retired women sitting outside a cafe said they supported the protest. “I think it's good … They're only protecting the children. That's all they're doing,” said one woman, who would not give her name because “you can't have an opinion because you'll get locked up”.\\nWarwickshire's police chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to Finch on Wednesday, writing that the police had asked the Home Office to confirm the immigration status of the two men accused in connection with the alleged rape, and “did not and will not cover up such criminality”.\\nCare workers Chijioke “CJ” Ani and Musa Samson, both originally from Nigeria, had also heard about the protest. Ani said he would go to work and go home, and not stay in the town on Saturday.\\nHe said he had seen a lot of anti-immigration sentiment on social media. “Some of them are misinformed or acting out of impulse,” he said. “It makes me feel like someone will attack me someday. It's definitely getting worse because the far right are getting stronger.”\\nWhile the men, originally from Nigeria, had found Nuneaton to be a friendly town, Samson said he had experienced some racism with men making noises at him as he approached a local bar. \\nMost people the Guardian spoke to in Nuneaton said they would be avoiding the town centre.\\nLawrence McIntyre was serving teas and coffees from The Kiosk in the town centre. He said: “I do feel sorry if it does put people off coming down shopping. The market traders and the small businesses, they rely on [customers].”\\nHe said there had been plenty of diversity in the town for a long time and it had not been a problem until now.\\nIn Altrincham, Greater Manchester, protesters and counter-protesters were separated by a busy road outside the Cresta Court hotel. Far-right agitators were met locals who shouted about apparent crimes that they said asylum seekers had committed.\\n“Go back to where you've come from, we don't want you,” shouted one woman towards the hotel. On the other side of the road, counter-protesters chanted that refugees were welcome. In a rare moment of unity, the far right began singing “fuck Keir Starmer” to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes and the anti-fascists joined in.\\n• This article was amended on 9 August 2025.

         "[\"When Tabytha Gonzalez's brother died earlier this year, her Black transgender community rallied around her to “take care of what I needed to get through this process of grief”, she said. The mutual aid collective Black Trans Travel Fund provided her with $250 to buy an outfit, pay for a car service from New York City to New Jersey for the funeral and to purchase food while she was there. “I was able to get what I needed to get there, I was able to have water, I was able to buy things; my basic needs were met in that moment,” Gonzalez said. “Funerals are expensive. It helped me … show up in a way that was respectful.”\\nFounded in 2019, Black Trans Travel Fund began as a ride program for Black trans people in New York and New Jersey to pay for car services such as Lyft twice a week. It has since expanded to a global funding source for people who need help paying for TSA pre-check, flights, passports and emergencies, with an eye toward self autonomy so that trans people have a say in how they spend the money. Safe transportation is of particular importance to the Black trans community, since they're at increased risk for harassment and violence when cycling, walking or using public transit. At least 32 trans and gender nonconforming people were killed in 2024, with 56% of them being Black trans women, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\\nBut Black Trans Travel Fund is strapped for resources since individual donations have declined in recent months due to fear around the Trump administration's policies targeting trans people, said the group's founder and co-director Devin Michael Lowe. “With the political climate that we're in, the cost of food is skyrocketing, housing costs have skyrocketed,” Lowe told the Guardian. “And there's been so much backlash against trans people all across the country.”\\nOver the past year, the group has had to adjust its programs in the face of an increasingly anti-trans political climate. Following Trump's executive order that only two sexes, male and female, would be recognized by the government, several transgender people told Lowe that the US Department of State confiscated their passports when they tried to renew them. So in February, the group paused its sponsorship of passports and plane tickets to avoid putting trans people in further danger.\\nFollowing a June preliminary injunction on the Trump administration's policy requiring that a person's passport reflect their sex assigned at birth, though, the organization recently began sponsoring passports again for trans women in the US. And due to the US's cuts to foreign aid and development assistance, the group has focused much of its efforts on helping Black trans women in other nations, including Uganda, seek safety.\\n“People have had some really serious concerns about their capacity to travel lately,” Lowe said. Trans women who need to travel for work “have concerns about facing harassment at the airport, or not getting their documents”. Lowe said that for transgender people preparing to travel, their “mental health is being impacted deeply. People are stressed out about what are going to be the continued effects.”\\nTrump's recent executive orders targeting trans people, “really has us in a whirlwind”, Lowe said. “And I think that is one of the tactics. Fascism makes it difficult for you to do anything. They want us to be overwhelmed by the amount of things that are happening at once, and it feels undefeatable.”\\nLaunched by Lowe, a Black trans man in the Bronx neighborhood of New York City, the Black Trans Travel Fund was originally created as a way to safely transport Black trans women to and from Pride events six years ago. In May 2019, three Black trans women – Muhlaysia Booker, Claire Legato, and Tamika Washington – were fatally shot in the span of a week. Lowe attended a rally in New York City about the murders affecting his community, in which he said white politicians paid “lip service” about the need to combat the violence without taking any action. So Lowe decided to take matters into his own hands by soliciting donations through social media, resulting in him raising $20,000 within a few weeks.\\n“One of the core values of Black Trans Travel Fund is autonomy over what they're doing,” Lowe said. “I can't tell you the amount of times that a woman has told me her experience of getting assaulted or harassed on the metro. So I wanted to ensure that when people are receiving support, they're able to utilize it in a way that feels safest for them.” According to the Black Trans Travel Fund, the team utilized more than $385,000 over five years to allow hundreds of people to pay for Uber rides, train tickets or gas for their friends' cars through their bi-weekly ride sponsorship program.\\nThe flagship ride program was paused in 2024 due to a loss of funding. But with additional resources, Lowe and his team hope to restart it in the future. Altogether, Lowe said that the organization has donated more than $730,000 to help people around the world with travel, housing and medical costs since its inception. The group recently launched a $500,000 fundraising campaign to increase their mutual aid efforts and to make traveling more accessible for even more Black trans women.\\nIn the face of limited budget cuts and executive orders, the fund has pivoted its focus to providing emergency support to trans women globally, where applicants receive $200 within a couple of days to leave abusive environments, to cover funeral arrangement costs, or to pay for safe transportation to medical appointments.\\nIn recent months, the Black Trans Travel Fund has received emergency requests from people throughout the world who need access to HIV medication due to the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID, a governmental agency that provided foreign aid and development assistance. “We really do not discriminate to the best of our ability,” Lowe said. “We have a limited amount of funding each month, so if we do receive an overwhelming number of requests we will try to prioritize the ones that feel the most urgent.”\\nThe organization has also focused its efforts on a grant program to support Black trans-led organizations and shelter spaces domestically and internationally. Over the past year, the group has provided 11 organizations with nearly $16,000. Some of the funding has gone toward rent, food, transportation and hygiene supplies for Black trans people affected by HIV and Aids at Devin's House of Hope, a shelter in Uganda named after Lowe.\\nIn Uganda, where an anti-LGBTQ+ law passed two years ago, trans people are arrested, detained and extorted for money by authorities. The harsh political climate has led to harassment and discrimination on the streets, Lowe said, and it's difficult for trans people to rent housing.\\n“Even though trans people [in the US] are navigating homelessness and joblessness as well, there are more protections here legally in terms of us at least being able to apply to housing if you have the money,” Lowe said, “Whereas a lot of folks internationally are getting kicked out for ‘homosexual behavior', like neighbors will tell people's landlords.”\\nThe Black Trans Travel Fund helped Ruthra Lubega, a Black trans man from Kampala, Uganda, escape from the nation and seek asylum in New York last year. Lubega met Lowe at a meeting of LGBTQ+ leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2022. At the time, Lubega was homeless, and wanted to create a shelter for trans people living with HIV/Aids. Later that year, the Black Trans Travel Fund raised funds for rent and bedding supplies to launch Devin's House of Hope, where more than 180 trans people from throughout Africa have sought safety. The travel fund has also helped the shelter purchase a car and a motorbike for Lubega to distribute HIV medication and condoms throughout the community.\\n“During my work and advocacy I used to face many challenges,” Lubega told the Guardian. “I was in prison many times because of my gender identity. I was beaten many times.” Then last summer, Lubega said that his photo appeared in a Ugandan newspaper's list of “top human rights defenders that recruit young women to homosexuality”. Lubega's life was at risk due to the anti-LGBTQ+ law, so the Black Trans Travel Fund raised money for him to fly to New York.\\nNow, Lubega lives in a New York shelter and is trying to attain his green card as he continues to run Devin's House of Hope from afar. Lubega said that ever since he learned of Black Trans Travel Fund, “they have done a great job of changing the lives of Black trans women and men in Uganda.”\\nIn the face of global trans misogynoir, the Black Trans Travel Fund team also sponsors events for their community to celebrate their lives and experience joy. The group is now raising money to provide trans women with funding for rides following a Black trans women cookout at New York City's Socrates Sculpture Park on 24 August. And at in the fall, they plan to host a fundraising event to raise money for a ball in Kingston, Jamaica, in November.\", \"The number of LGBTQ+ Americans inquiring about moving to Canada has soared since Donald Trump's re-election, campaigners have said, as people across the US wrestle with the fallout of rising anti-gay rhetoric, anti-trans executive orders, and the more than 600 bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights.\\n“So much is happening in the US right now and a lot of it is terrifying,” said Latoya Nugent of Rainbow Railroad, a North American charity that helps LGBTQI+ individuals escape violence and persecution in their home countries.\\nIn the first eight months of this year, the organisation has received 4,197 calls from people living in the US – a surge of 760% compared with the same period last year. “The overwhelming majority of individuals who are reaching out want support with international relocation, which translates to ‘I want to get out of the US because I'm afraid of living here,'” said Nugent.\\nThe phones at Rainbow Railroad – which usually receives about 12,000 calls a year from around the world – began lighting up in November, as more than 1,100 calls poured in within 24 hours after Trump's re-election. “For the first time in our history, the US emerged as the number one country where people request help from,” said Nugent.\\nThe trend seems likely to continue this year. “A significant number of them are reporting that they're fearful of what may happen to them, given the political climate and the emerging policy and legal landscape for LGBTQI+ people,” Nugent said.\\nSince returning to office this year, Trump has carried out an unprecedented assault on the community: announcing that the US would only recognise two genders; targeting diversity, equity and inclusion measures; and signing executive orders that sought to exclude transgender people from the US military, limit their access to sport, and curtail gender-transition procedures for people under 19.\\nThe president's first 100 days in office saw LGBTQ+ individuals targeted at least 255 times, both via policy shifts and rhetoric, according to the US advocacy organisation Glaad.\\nPoliticians in some US states have seized on the moment, presenting 604 anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the state level, according to tracking by the American Civil Liberties Union. Republicans in red states have sought measures that target same-sex marriage, while in May, Utah became the first state to explicitly bar the flying of LGBTQ+ flags at government buildings and schools. More than a dozen states soon followed with similar bans.\\nAt Rainbow Railroad, about 61% of callers from the US identify as trans, said Nugent, reflecting the administration's constant and relentless targeting of trans individuals.\\nOthers told the organisation that they were nervously watching the attacks play out. “If you are aware of what's happening globally, you know that this is the beginning of the worst that is to come,” she said. “In the US, trans-identified people have become the first line of attack against the entire LGBTQI+ community, and there's this growing fear that it will not stop there.”\\nDespite the growing fears, the current Canadian options for those who feel persecuted in the US remain slim. Those who call Rainbow Railroad are told that the most likely options for relocation are via economic pathways or via family reunification.\\nHope, however, has been sparked by two recent immigration cases.\\nIn July, a Canadian judge halted plans to deport a non-binary artist from Minnesota, arguing that the decision had failed to take into account the “current conditions for LGBTQ, non-binary and transgender persons” in the US. Since then, debate has swirled over the extent to which the precedent will force immigration officials in Canada to consider the current climate for people in the US.\\nAnother case that is being closely watched is that of a 22-year-old transgender woman from Arizona. After crossing into Canada earlier this year, Hannah Kreager filed an asylum claim in June, on the grounds that Trump's anti-trans policies have left her fearing persecution.\\nHer lawyer, Yameena Ansari, described the case as potentially precedent-setting, in that it could recognise how the Trump administration has specifically targeted the LGBTQ+ community in the US. With these claims, “historically we're talking about people from east Africa, west Africa, we're talking about people from Russia or from Islamic countries, we are not talking about America,” she said. “But with each day that goes by, I feel more and more convinced that she has a legitimate claim.”\\nThe claim, which Ansari said could be heard as early as next summer, has sparked debate across the country, with many pointing to fact that refugees in Canada must demonstrate that they cannot obtain protection from their home state and that they are unable to relocate to a safe place anywhere within their own country.\\nThe last point, in particular, has left Ansari preparing to show that there is no other US state in which her client could be safe. “If she goes into a federal building, she cannot pee in the right bathroom,” she said. “If she's locked up in a federal institution, where are they going to lock her up? Are they going to lock her up in the male institution? Are they going to provide her with gender-affirming care?”\\nFrom the start, her client had understood that this route was far from guaranteed. But she had seized on it, seeing it as a singular chance to carve out a safe exit path for herself and the many others reeling from the Trump administration's constant and relentless attacks, said Ansari. “She's not just doing this for herself. For her, this is very much a cause.”\\nThe glimmer of hope had led to a raft of calls from others in similar situations, she added. “Already just her courage in bringing this forward has inspired a lot of people in her community,” she said. “Right now I have so many more clients coming to me. Why? Because they read about Hannah's case and they know there's some lawyer who sees their pain and doesn't dismiss it. Who says this is real and I think it's so real that the courts should recognise your fear.”\", \"Publications aimed at LGBTQ+ and other diverse audiences are facing “good old-fashioned discrimination” as advertisers avoid them after political attacks on diversity and inclusion campaigns, editors have said.\\nSenior figures at publications aimed at the gay community and other minority groups said a previous “gold rush” to work with such titles was over.\\nThere has been a backlash in the US over corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the past 18 months, which has led to some big names rolling back their plans.\\nTag Warner, the chief executive of Gay Times, said his publication, which had been growing digitally in the US, had lost 80% of its advertisers in the past year. It has also lost in excess of £5m in expected advertiser revenue.\\nWarner, who has led the outlet since 2019, said his title's growth had been accompanied by an enthusiasm from brands to embrace LGBTQ+ audiences. He blames an anti-DEI drive in the US for the dramatic shift.\\n“I know that media and marketing is also going through a challenging year anyway, but when we're thinking about other organisations that don't talk to diverse themes, they're not nearly as impacted as we are,” he said. “This is just good old-fashioned discrimination. Because discrimination doesn't have to make business sense. Discrimination doesn't have to be logical. Discrimination is discrimination.\\n“We're really experiencing the impact of what happens when voices that are pressuring organisations to give in to less inclusive perspectives start winning. Then it creates this massive behavioural shift in brands and organisations.”\\nNafisa Bakkar, the co-founder of Amaliah, a publication aimed at “amplifying the voices of Muslim women”, said there had been a “change in mood” among brands and advertisers. “There was this DNI [diversity and inclusion] gold rush,” she said. “It is, I would say, well and truly over.\\n“We work with a lot of UK advertisers, but I would say that the US has a lot more emphasis on what they would call ‘brand safety', which I think is a code word for ‘we don't want to rock the boat'. I would say there is a lot more focus on this element.”\\nIbrahim Kamara, the founder of the youth platform GUAP, which has a large black and ethnically diverse audience, said he had detected a “relative difference” from 2020 in approaches from brands.\\nHe and others cited the economic pressures on advertisers generally in recent years. However, he said the “hype and the PR around wanting to support and connect with diverse audiences” had also subsided.\\n“The thing that most people within these kind of spaces can probably agree on is that the energy and the PR is very different now,” he said. “It was almost a badge of honour to be able to say that you're supporting certain communities. Now, I've seen that lots of the diversity and inclusion people that were hired around that period have probably lost their jobs. It doesn't have the same PR effect any more.”\\nWarner said the anti-DEI impact pre-dated the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Figures such as the conservative pundit Robby Starbuck have been engaged in a long-running anti-DEI campaign, pressuring firms to drop their diversity efforts. However, Warner said Trump's arrival “gave everyone, I think, permission to be honest about it”.\\nNot all publications in the sector have been hit in the same way as Gay Times. Companies with business models less reliant on US advertising, as well as some big players with long-established relationships, said they had managed to negotiate the changing political environment.\\n“Brands are nervous, that's for sure, or careful – or a combination of both,” said Darren Styles, the managing director of Stream Publishing, which publishes Attitude magazine. “They're aware it can be a lightning rod for a vocal minority. But our experience is that most people are holding their ground, if not doubling down.”\\nStyles also said he was not complacent, however, given the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform party in the UK and its lack of historical support for the LGBTQ+ community.\\n“I'm not incautious about the future,” he said. “Who knows what next year will bring, because that narrative is not going away. Obviously, there's the rise of Reform in the polls.\\n“[Farage] is quite clearly not an ally to our community and he's expressed disdain in the past at the awards we've given out to people in the trans community. So it is a worry as political momentum gains around there. But I think broadly, consumers in the UK are a bit more capable of thinking for themselves.”\\nMark Berryhill, the chief executive of equalpride, which publishes prominent US titles like Out and The Advocate, said some brands and agencies “may have been a little bit more cautious than they have been in the past”. However, he said it had so far meant deals had taken longer to be completed, in a tough economic climate.\\nHe said the political headwinds made it more important to highlight that working with such titles was simply a sound business decision. “We've tried to do a better job in this political climate of just selling the importance of our buying power,” he said. “Everybody's cautious and I don't think it's just LGBTQ. I think they're cautious in general right now with their work with minority owned companies.\\n“The one thing that maybe this whole controversy has helped us with a little bit is to really make brands realise it's a business decision. It's not just a charity or something you should do because you feel guilty.\\n“You should do it because it's the right thing to support LGBTQ journalism. We're small. We need to get the word out. We have important stories to tell. But it's also a good business decision. The more we show that side, certain brands will come along.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"Good morning. Just how many migrants in the UK are undocumented?\\nTabloid headlines can make it seem like the number is huge, so perhaps a new YouGov poll suggesting a significant gap between public perception and reality should be no surprise. Nearly half of Britons (47%) believe there are more undocumented migrants living in the UK than those here legally. Meanwhile, 45% of respondents said they support stopping all immigration and carrying out deportations of people who have arrived in recent years.\\nTensions are playing out on the streets, with protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers attracting national attention, including in Epping, Essex, where hundreds of people gathered over several weekends after the arrest of a resident on suspicion of sexual assault. More protests are expected over the next few days. Adding to the pressure, police are also preparing for possible protests in support of Palestine Action over the weekend, despite the group's recent proscription as a terrorist organisation. Officers have warned that anyone carrying placards or banners expressing support could face arrest and incarceration in our already overcrowded prisons.\\nSo who is behind the anti-immigration protests, and what's driving them? And could this weekend become a flashpoint? To explore this further, I spoke to the Guardian's senior reporter Ben Quinn, who has spent years reporting on the far right.\\nUS immigration | A new report found hundreds of credible reported cases of human rights abuses in US immigration detention centres. The alleged abuses uncovered include physical and sexual abuse of detainees.\\nProtest | Naomi Klein and Angela Davis are among dozens of international scholars and writers who have signed a letter to the Guardian calling on the UK government to reverse the ban on Palestine Action.\\nRussia | Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff have held talks in Moscow, two days before a Friday deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the Ukraine war.\\nSpain | A local authority in south-east Spain has banned Muslims from using public facilities such as civic centres and gyms to celebrate the religious festivals Eid. The ban in Jumilla, in Murcia, is a first in Spain.\\nUK news | The Bank of England is poised to cut interest rates on Thursday despite a growing divide between its policymakers over the dangers to the economy from high inflation and rising unemployment.\\nEstimates of the population of undocumented migrants living in the UK range from 120,000 to 1.3 million, with Reform UK's Zia Yusuf recently putting the figure at 1.2 million.\\nRegardless, that number doesn't come close to those living in the UK legally: the 2021-22 census (pdf) put the entire foreign-born population of the UK at 10.7 million. But lies travel fast on social media – especially if they chime with existing worries or prejudice.\\nThe news last year that three girls attending a dance class in Southport were stabbed to death sent out shockwaves. As the local community gathered to mourn, a piece of disinformation – that the attacker had come to the UK on a small boat – quickly spread on social media. That sparked protests, which were very quickly exploited by far-right activists. The protests exploded, with anti-migrant rioters attacking mosques, setting fire to asylum hotels, and assaulting black and minority ethnic people.\\nIt's been a year since, but the anger has not dissipated. Instead, it is slowly hardening into a movement. Anti-immigration protests have taken place across the country and while most have remained peaceful, some have not. The BBC reported that 15 people across the country have been arrested in recent days while protesting outside hotels used to house asylum seekers.\\n“We're in what Joe Mulhall of Hope Not Hate calls the ‘post-organisational era' of the far right,” says Ben. “It's not about formal parties and memberships. It's about individuals loosely linked via social media, people who might never meet in person but have significant influence, especially on platforms like X. That all feeds into gatherings and protests, which then spill over into violence, as we saw after Southport.”\\nHe added that protests outside asylum hotels have always happened. The Bell Hotel in Epping, which has seen recent large scale protests, has actually been targeted since 2021. But these protests, once considered fringe events, are becoming a fixture.\\n“If you place Reform UK as a hard-right populist party, the groups we're seeing at the protest sit further to the right,” Ben told me. “For a while, Patriotic Alternative was the main far-right group, but it's in decline now, as a result of infighting. A newer group, Homeland Party, was set up by former far-right members and has drawn people away from Patriotic Alternative.”\\nBut he warned that we have to be careful when discussing who is involved. “They are clearly organised far-right activists who are attempting to exploit local grievances and are using misinformation to whip up feelings, but in some cases, such as Epping, the protests have included local people who are unaffiliated with organised far-right groups. There is a grey area which is difficult to determine in some cases.”\\nHe added that the big shadow over all of this is Tommy Robinson. “He's the epitome of that post-organisational far right. He's an influencer and clearly an activist, and he's got a universe of people around him, who in many cases include football hooligans.”\\nRobinson tried to amplify protests in Islington and Canary Wharf, targeting hotels thought to house asylum seekers, Ben explained. There are also other figures forming a constellation of newer far-right influencers who have attached themselves to this.\\n***\\nAre all the protesters far-right agitators?\\nWhile notable far-right figures have been spotted speaking at the protests, Ben has spoken to many who wouldn't align themselves with those groups, but are still frustrated with the country's asylum policies.\\n“It's really important to not discount the fact that people in these communities have agency of their own to go and protest and they can feel very strongly about things. They have views on the asylum system, they have views on events in the news,” Ben said.\\n“There is a debate to be had, and many media organisations will be having it, about how these protests should be described. I spoke to a local woman in Essex who said ‘we're turning up here because a teenager was allegedly sexually assaulted by a man who was in this hostel. We want to turn up and show we're not happy with this'. Are they far right purely for taking part in that protest? They would say of course not. But should they turn away from a protest when it becomes clear that it is being hijacked by neo-Nazis and far-right groups? Some would say, yes, they should.”\\n***\\nWill this weekend be a flashpoint?\\nThere is widespread reporting of a “no asylum day of action” today, but Ben believes it is not clear whether it's a real national action or a meme that has taken on a life of its own. He pointed to an incident last year where someone published a list of immigration advice centres across the country, but the protests didn't materialise.\\nThere is some evidence to show that momentum around some of these protests is beginning to slow down.\\n“It feels like the heat has come out of Epping a little bit. At the last protest, anti-racism activists and trade unionists outnumbered the protest against that hotel. And that was a place far-right activists had very clearly wanted to turn it into pilgrimage every weekend. But now it seems that perhaps the focus has shifted. It might be because lots of local people were turned off by the violence which erupted on the sidelines of those protests. But the problem is, we now have lots of others elsewhere,” Ben said.\\nThere is now widespread attention in Nuneaton because of another alleged sexual assault case there, involving a 12-year-old alleged victim. Reform council leader George Finch made comments that may be in contempt of court and have inflamed tensions, Ben said. Protests are planned at the council HQ. Other hotspots include Cannock and Waterlooville, which recently saw a thousand people protesting, he added.\\n“In places like London and Essex, anti-racist activists can mobilise very quickly in large numbers and also draw some local support and outnumber the far right. But you also have other places where there are large groups of local people who are unattached with the far right, gathering in large numbers and then you have the far right exploiting them.”\\n***\\nHow has the government responded?\\nThere has been a notable difference in the government's response to this year's protests outside asylum hotels. “After Southport, Keir Starmer called them ‘far-right riots'. He hasn't done that this time, even though the far right is heavily involved. Labour seems worried about alienating voters on immigration,” Ben said. He added that many are also critical of Starmer and Yvette Cooper for failing to condemn the racist language heard at some of these protests.\\nAnd the possibility of further national riots loom. “There's potential,” said Ben, “because we're in August. The weather's hot and rain is always one of the things that keeps people off the street. You have misinformation, the far right and others colonising local Facebook groups, with Nigel Farage and Reform amplifying many of the messages from the protests.\\n“And then you have a stretched police force as well” – stretched not only by anti-migrant protests, but by a wave of demonstrations this weekend, with hundreds expected to defy terrorism legislation to rally in support of Palestine Action. \\nThe two protests will paint a stark picture of modern Britain. On one side, police in soft caps are expected to make mass arrests, mostly of elderly people or students, with little anticipation of violence. On the other, riot vans and officers in full gear will line the streets at anti-migrant demonstrations, prepared for the possibility that unrest could erupt once again.\\nAs many as 80,000 people in Hiroshima were killed instantly when the US dropped the first nuclear bomb this week in August 1945.

An award-winning poet, a decorated army officer, and a retired head teacher are handcuffed together in the back of a police van ... It's not the start of a terrible joke, but a representation of just some of the eyebrow-raising arrests the police have made in recent weeks.\\nThese eminently establishment figures are just a few of the 700 arrested for showing support for Palestine Action after it was proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Many were in their seventies or older, and video footage made one of the mass arrests look like a giant garden party gone sour.\\nSafe to say, manhandling octogenarians is sub-optimal optics for the police. “I've never been arrested before so I'm quite nervous, actually,” said one elderly man wearing a beige blazer.\\nBut bigger shifts in policing appear to be under way. Most recently, new government guidance says police forces should look to disclose the ethnicity and migration status of suspects charged in high-profile investigations. Although this may solve one headache for the criminal justice system – stopping the spread of conspiracies about alleged offenders – it could create another by damaging race relations across the country.\\nFor today's newsletter, Rajeev Syal, home affairs editor at the Guardian, discusses the police's pivot to a more authoritarian approach to protest, the potential impacts of releasing information about race, and which voters are being wooed. That's after the headlines.\\nUkraine | Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have hailed “a visible chance for peace” in Ukraine, as long as Vladimir Putin proves he is serious about ending the war when he meets Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday.\\nEducation | Students in England gained record levels of top grades in this year's A-level exams, driven by young men producing their strongest performances outside the pandemic years.\\nGaza | More than 100 aid organisations working in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank have accused Israel of “weaponising aid” in its application of rules for groups involved in delivering humanitarian assistance.\\nClimate crisis | UK firefighters have warned that 2025 is on track to beat the national record for wildfires, with frontline staff “pushed to their limits”.\\nUS news | Donald Trump cold-called Norway's finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian press reported.\\nA total of 532 people were arrested in London last Saturday at the largest demonstration in support of Palestine Action. Most of them were simply holding supportive placards or signs. Half of the people arrested were aged 60 or older, according to police figures. Nearly 100 of those detained were in their 70s and 15 were in their 80s.\\nPolice officers manning the protest were obliged to make these arrests. “It's not how one would envisage the job. And they are just doing their job,” says Rajeev Syal. “When you speak to officers privately, they know that they're not picking up thugs, they're picking up people who are motivated by politics and beliefs, and they're also peaceful. So it does certainly make police officers sit up and think.”\\nSuch events illustrate broader changes in policing driven by changing priorities in the Labour government. “I would say that this government has certainly moved towards a more authoritarian line on protests compared to previous governments,” says Rajeev.\\n“It does look as if they are pivoting towards an electorate who are less comfortable with asylum seekers in their constituencies, who are more worried about small boats coming over the sea. They know they have to win those people over in order to win a general election.”\\nThe surge in Reform UK support has made the government nervous, even though we're barely a year past an historic landslide election. Labour remain focused on so-called red wall seats dominated by white working-class voters in market, former mill and seaside towns. “Those are the places they think they've got to win people over,” explains Rajeev. \\n***\\nWhat is the logic behind revealing the racial identity of suspects?\\nIn recent days, home secretary Yvette Cooper, welcomed new police guidelines that encourage forces to release the race and nationality of those charged in high-profile cases. It comes after an independent watchdog found that failure to share basic facts about the Southport killer last summer led to “dangerous fictions” which helped spark riots across the country.\\nThe policy is designed to work on two fronts, explains Rajeev. Firstly, the government wants to stop the rise of the far right and their ability to organise through misinformation and fomenting public disorder by spreading untruths about suspects (such as the Southport case). And secondly, it sends a signal to potential Reform UK voters that the government is taking the issue of people committing crimes while applying for asylum seriously.\\n“Reform UK politicians have promoted the idea that the government and the police are involved in a cover-up of information, and this allows the government to say, ‘well we can't be',” says Rajeev. “I think there's a lot of politics involved behind some of these decisions: it's the politics of winning over Reform voters and undermining Reform in those pivotal seats that will define the next election.”\\n***\\nWhat are the criticisms of the policy?\\nThe family of Bebe King, one of the three girls killed in the Southport attack last year, have expressed their dismay at the decision. They have urged ministers to reconsider support for disclosing the ethnicity of serious crime suspects saying the information was “completely irrelevant”. The family's position is that mental health issues, and the propensity to commit crime, have nothing to do with ethnicity, nationality or race. Their argument is that such tragedies are too often used as a political football, especially by the far right.\\nCampaigners have argued it could set a dangerous precedent for “dog-whistle politics”, Rajeev says: “When a suspect involved in an alleged crime is thought to be a black or brown person, or an asylum seeker, there will be huge pressure on the Home Office from right-leaning media and on social media to release details … but there won't be as much pressure, when it's obviously a white man.”\\n“This will add to the distorted impression that minority ethnic people and refugees are responsible for a disproportionate number of crimes.”\\n***\\nWhat is the counter argument?\\nLawrence Sherman, a criminology professor from the University of Cambridge, and ex-chief scientific officer for the Met Police, disagrees that it will inflame racial tensions – he believes the opposite to be true.\\nLast summer, after false rumours spawned online about the Southport killer's foreign nationality, the police were not in a position to correct the misinformation. “I would say that was a problem with the rules,” he says. These rules have now been changed.\\nSherman believes that stating the demographic details of suspects will help with transparency. “Especially in an era of what Richard Hofstadter, the American historian, called ‘paranoid politics', in which people are always suspicious of ‘elites' trying to cover things up. Greater transparency about all these things will help to shape a dialogue around peacekeeping on one hand and proportionality on the other.”\\nAnd while the far right may be championing the changes, he cautions it may not have the result they are hoping for: “Being transparent about it will remind people that there's a lot of very violent white people in this country.”\\nAs early 2000s attitudes favouring thinness return to the fore, Lucy Knight does a deep dive interview with the unapologetic Bob Harper, personal trainer and TV personality, who hosted the controversial US show ‘The Biggest Loser'.

At least 1,500 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are preparing to break terror law tomorrow.\\nTheir planned action? Sitting on the floor holding signs that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” The group was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July. The campaign Defend Our Juries is planning a major escalation from its last major protest in August, when more than 500 people were arrested – beating the record from the poll tax riots. Half of those arrested supporting Palestine Action were over the age 60.\\nThis time, organisers expect protesters in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland to join the mass civil disobedience, which they describe as an “unprecedented simultaneous challenge to all three legal systems within the UK's constitutional framework”.\\nThese protesters will be joined by a coalition of major civil society organisations, including Black Lives Matter UK, Palestine Solidarity Campaign, and Stop the War Coalition, who have announced the formation of a bloc and that they will be acting as witnesses to the policing of Saturday's demonstrations.\\nBut with Yvette Cooper holding firm on proscribing Palestine Action, the question is begged: who will blink first?\\nTo explore that question and the tactics now in play on both sides, I spoke to Guardian senior reporter Ben Quinn, who has been reporting on the protests. That's after the headlines.\\nIsrael | Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, will visit London next Thursday just weeks before the UK is expected to recognise the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly, the Guardian understands. It would be the first time a senior Israeli leader came to Britain since the foreign secretary, David Lammy, met his Israeli counterpart on an unannounced visit in the spring.\\nPolitics | Nigel Farage is using a private company to reduce his tax bill on his GB News media appearances and other outside employment in a television star-style arrangement that has in recent years become frowned on by major broadcasters.\\nUK news | A man who became the focus of far-right demonstrations outside a hotel in Epping, Essex where he and others were housed has been found guilty of sexual assault against two 14-year-old girls.\\nBanking | Lloyds Banking Group is to warn 3,000 staff that they are at risk of being sacked for underperformance as part of a management overhaul led by the chief executive, Charlie Nunn.\\nFashion | Giorgio Armani, the celebrated Italian fashion designer who built a global empire, has died, his company said on Thursday. He was 91.\\nDefend our Juries was co-founded by Tim Crosland, a former government lawyer and environmental activist, who told Ben Quinn this summer that he was taking part in this action of mass civil disobedience because it was his “duty to intervene”.\\nCrosland and others were due for an online press conference on Tuesday, but Crosland was unable to attend because he was arrested and had his home raided just hours beforehand, alongside five other Defend Our Juries spokespeople.\\nThey have since been charged with terrorism offences, but released on bail. Speaking from when he was in custody over the phone, Crosland released the following statement: “It's empowering to see that we're driving the state to such desperate and embarrassing measures: treating us as terrorists for peacefully holding cardboard signs in Parliament Square.”\\nAs well as arresting the organisers of Saturday's protest, the police have issued strong warnings to those thinking of taking part. “They've been stressing the consequences of terrorism convictions, from being denied university places to losing jobs. They want potential participants to think twice before joining,” Ben said.\\nDefend Our Juries suggests that putting its members off is unlikely, issuing a press release under the headline: “We will not be silenced.”\\n***\\nTrialed and tested tactics\\nThe tactic of mass arrests is not new in the UK. Environmentalists have used it for decades, and many of those involved with Defend Our Juries are veteran campaigners with a long history of civil disobedience.\\n“This is the same playbook as Extinction Rebellion. The idea that you force change by peaceful mass arrests, which overwhelm not just the police, but the court system as well,” Ben said.\\nHe tells me that what's new for this Saturday is that Defend Our Juries' briefing document urges people to “go floppy” and refuse to give their name and address. That means police have to take them to stations. The organisation has advised protesters not to comply with what they describe as the “charade” of street bail, where people are processed on the side of the road, bailed and told to attend a police station on another day after handing over their details and ID.\\n“So that's deliberately designed to ratchet up the pressure on the police so that there won't be enough space in all the police cells and stations in London to accommodate this number of people,” Ben said. The Met itself has admitted that these actions present “entirely unrealistic challenges” in the past, Ben added.\\nWhat happens if the police are overstretched from an action like this? “They just can't arrest people and then you've got people, in theory, breaking counter-terror laws and nobody's doing anything about it,” Ben said. “In the previous protests, there were quite a number of people not arrested even though they were holding the signs saying ‘I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action'.”\\nThese tactics are not just meant to overwhelm the police. “Other primary aims are to generate media attention and generate discussion about what's happening in Gaza and the proscription of Palestine Action.”\\n***\\nSpeaking out against the proscription\\nThe arrests at the last protest drew media attention not just because of the number of arrests, but who was arrested. They include 75-year-old Sir Jonathon Porritt, a former government official; 75-year-old Chris Romberg, a former British army officer colonel and military attache at UK embassies in Egypt and Jordan, and the son of a Holocaust survivor; and award-winning 58-year-old poet Alice Oswald.\\nThe most famous name who has come out in support of Palestine Action is award-winning and bestselling novelist Sally Rooney. The Irish novelist was due to speak at Defend our Juries' Tuesday presser before its cancellation. Last month, she pledged to use proceeds from her books, including Normal People and Conversations with Friends, along with BBC adaptations of them, to support Palestine Action.\\n“Questions now arise about whether she'd feel safe coming to Britain, given her public support for Palestine Action,” Ben told me. “And Amnesty International is running an international campaign against the proscription, so the government is under pressure on multiple fronts.”\\nOthers to criticise the proscription include the former cabinet minister Peter Hain, who warned the UK government was “digging itself into a hole” over Palestine Action.\\n“The more interesting thing in some ways is whether Labour backbenchers themselves have started having second thoughts about the proscription, and whether enough of them might want to apply some pressure as well,” Ben said.\\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy co-wrote an opinion piece with Hain calling for a review of terrorism legislation following Palestine Action arrests. That call was later echoed by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey.\\n***\\nUnder pressure\\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has shown no sign of retreat on her decision to proscribe Palestine Action, while Defend our Juries hopes to ramp up the pressure to the point the law is unworkable and she is forced to resign.\\nIs there an off-ramp? Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori has been allowed to bring an unprecedented legal challenge to the home secretary's decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws. If Ammori wins, it would throw the arrests and charges into chaos.\\nAt the heart of the high court's decision to allow the challenge were cases of police overreach. One was that of Laura Murton, who the Guardian revealed had been threatened with arrest by armed officers for holding a sign saying “Free Gaza” and a Palestinian flag. Since then, Ben has reported on the case of Miles Pickering, who was arrested for wearing a T-shirt reading “Plasticine Action.”\\n“The police apparently misread it at the time of his arrest. Only after he arrived at Scotland Yard did they realise the mistake, which shows the very difficult position the police are in with these tactics,” Ben said.\\nWhile the legal challenge could provide an off-ramp for Palestine Action and the government, it would feel like a humiliating defeat for the latter.\\n“It would be a massive embarrassment if Cooper loses this legal challenge,” Ben said. “Cooper would have been the person at the forefront of proscribing Palestine Action, so you can imagine calls for her to resign.”\\nHe explained that Amori's lawyers have already warned Cooper about her language, namely on the group being violent. There's also been pushback against Labour ministers suggesting Palestine Action targets Jewish businesses, while Palestine Action insist its actions have been against Israeli arms companies, not Jewish businesses.\\nIn another twist in the legal battle, the Home Office won permission to try to block Palestine Action's attempt to overturn its ban under terror laws.\\nThere are other challenges for the protesters too, Ben added. Can they keep up the momentum?

Lucy Mangan\\nMusicCMAT: Euro-Country | ★★★★★Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson (CMAT) unites two of the mid-2020s' most pervasive cultural trends: the so-called “green wave” of zeitgeist-dominating Irish actors, authors and musicians, and the irreverent embrace of country music by pop stars such as Beyoncé, Lana Del Rey and Chappell Roan. Even the most conventional song on Euro-Country, the cool R&B-pop of Running/Planning, is laden with bonkers lyrics about creating an imaginary boyfriend, ripping his head off and then promising to buy said head a Nintendo and “all the games”. It is exceptional because of how Thompson constantly strives – sometimes wryly, sometimes earnestly, always entertainingly – to capture messy psychological entrails that don't fit the template of the typical pop song.

As Gatsby's sad story unravels, the tone grows darker and the frivolity abates. But although the production does well to capture the hangover following the jazz age party, it underplays the tragedy of a man whose fatal flaw is to believe in a meritocratic US.

Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly different.\\nIn a poll conducted in late July by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering among Gaza's Palestinian population.\\nAccording to Anat Saragusti, an expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware of those reports because for months they have never seen them.\\n“Until a couple of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what's going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at all.”\\nIn the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas, and the country's military goals in Gaza. In that climate, the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas's attacks – although polls also show a clear majority want a deal with Hamas to end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.\\nMedia analysts say Israel's main broadcasters have largely embraced the narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country's history.\\nFor months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed up by Benjamin Netanyahu's claim last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAccording to UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza is going for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation.\\n“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.\\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.\\nEven Donald Trump, Netanyahu's key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue, said: “I don't know … those children look very hungry … that's real starvation stuff.”  \\nIn a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza and dismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack Israel.\\nHe compared these images with a photograph of the Israeli hostage Evyatar David released by the Palestinian militant group early in August, pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death, the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular. The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the public of Gaza.\\nSaragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership, insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAlthough Israel appears to exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recently filled the streets of Tel Aviv are now urging the government to halt the atrocities against the Palestinians.\\n“I think it is horrendous what is happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.”\\nGal Alkalay, 28, said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of our hostages.”\\nAnd yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals using the word “genocide” to describe their government's actions in Gaza – as the award-winning author David Grossman did just a fortnight ago – analysts say they remain a small minority.\\nIn Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align themselves with the narrative of Israel's political leadership.\\n\\nCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.\\nIsrael has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other restrictions include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.\\nPalestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over 180 killed since the conflict began.\\nThe committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.\\nForeign reporters based in Israel filed a legal petition seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by prominent journalists and media outlets have been ignored by the Israeli government.\\nTo ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual\\u200b\\u200b teams verif\\u200by photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.\\nEmma Graham-Harrison,\\xa0chief\\xa0Middle East correspondent\\n\\nAsked what she thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34, said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the security of our country.”\\nZalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas's ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the whole world's face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.”\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.\\nReporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have formally called for Gaza to be opened to foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.\\nMany argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the narrative.\\n“The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists, who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation but doesn't let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is starvation or not.”\\nUp to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded very well in its goal”.\", \"Good morning. Tony Blair is back and he has plans for the Middle East.\\nNo, you have not woken up and jumped back two decades in time. The former Labour leader, who was put under pressure to resign after the disastrous decision to go to war with Iraq – which led to the death of a million Iraqis and created a vacuum later filled by the brutal Islamic State – is back in the headlines this week.\\nBlair has attended a White House meeting with Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, according to recent reports.\\nThe former British prime minister has been working on a proposal for several months for the governance in Gaza after the war ends. The 72-year-old has reportedly been doing so with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, and the Emirati foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed.\\nWho appears to be missing from this roundtable on who will govern Palestinians in Gaza? The Palestinians themselves. While reporting suggests Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was briefed, there is little indication that Palestinians have any real say.\\nBut Palestinians are not voiceless as our current leaders often imply. Nor must they remain at the mercy of those more powerful. They also have their own plan for a postwar Gaza. To understand what leaders of Palestinian civil society are calling for, and what drives their continuing struggle for self-determination, I spoke to Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development and member of the steering committee of the Palestinian NGO Network. He is based in Ramallah. That's after the headlines.\\nUkraine | The UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged British Council and EU offices.\\nUK news | The Treasury is reportedly considering a tax on landlords in the autumn budget that would target income from rents. The proposals are centred on the expansion of national insurance to include rental income.\\nIran | The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites.\\nUS news | The White House named non-scientist Jim O'Neill, a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, to serve as acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid a standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez whose lawyers said she could only be removed by Donald Trump himself.\\nEnvironment | The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact.\\nAfter stepping down as UK prime minister in 2007, Tony Blair served as the UN Middle East envoy until 2015. He spent years visiting Jerusalem pushing for a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, but there was no resolution, nor any meaningful development towards a Palestinian state.\\nDetails of the plans being discussed by Blair, the US and Israeli officials remain scarce for now.\\nThe far right in Israel remains animated by a proposal announced in February, weeks after Donald Trump was elected, in which the US president effectively called for Gaza to be ethnically cleansed, the land seized by the US, and an international resort built. The “Gaza Riviera” plan was widely condemned, including by western-backed Arab allies. Trump has been a lot quieter on this plan since.\\nIn July, reports emerged that Blair's thinktank worked with a project developing a postwar Gaza plan that included the creation of a “Trump Riviera” and a manufacturing zone named after Elon Musk. The project was led by Israeli business people using financial models developed by the US firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) said it was not involved in the authorship of the plan but two staff members took part in calls as the project evolved. BCG has distanced itself significantly from the work in Gaza, reportedly firing two partners who it said had misled senior management.\\n“There is not a single Palestinian at the table” in these reported discussions, Ubai Al-Aboudi told me, “whether it's the Palestinian political leadership or representatives of Palestinian civil society and the wider Palestinian communities.” \\nHe added: “This is colonial practice. Palestinians must decide their own governance and future. But instead, while we are being genocided, the same powers complicit in the genocide are planning our future.”\\n***\\nWhat Palestinians want\\nAl-Aboudi dismissed Blair not only as a war criminal who must answer for the horrors that unfolded in Iraq, but for his role as the Middle Eastern envoy, “which failed in reining in Israel's policies of fragmentation, of, increased settlement activity, increased human rights violations against Palestinians, increased economic dependency of Palestinians”.\\nFrom the early days of the war in Gaza, Palestinian civil society has emphasised that any governance or rebuilding must have Palestinian agency at its core, Al-Aboudi explained, which factors in Palestinian cultural, historical, and socioeconomic heritage.\\n“It should take into account that 80% of the people living in Gaza, for example, are refugees whose fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed from their villages back in 1948. It should take into account that there should be unity between the West Bank and Gaza, and it should take into account that the Israeli system of control over Palestinians cannot continue and should not be allowed or maintained. No Israeli should have a say or a call on the future of any Palestinian; this should be the number one lesson from this genocide,” Al-Aboudi said. “What's happening right now is totally different. Palestinian voices are being totally ignored. The Palestinian narrative is being erased.”\\nHe said Palestinian civil society embraced the Egypt plan for Gaza, which was backed by the Arab league and Europe, which would rebuild Gaza and support Palestinian technocrats, operating under the management of the Palestinian Authority (PA), to take over Gaza's governance. The plan, which includes elections, would eventually lead to Gaza and the West Bank coming together as part of a Palestinian state.\\n“We have called for … a democratically elected leadership that would guide our people towards freedom … that would lift up our people. Unfortunately, all of these calls have fallen on deaf ears, whether from the international community or the US,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe denial of Palestinian autonomy\\nLife for Palestinians in the West Bank means being trapped between a rock and a hard place: the Israeli occupation on one side and a Palestinian Authority that works with it on the other.\\nAl-Aboudi's organisation, Bisan, works to secure socioeconomic rights for Palestinians and to advocate on their behalf “not just against Israeli occupation but also the Palestinian Authority and big business when they violate people's rights”.\\n“Our work has put us in the crosshairs of everyone. I've been arrested by both Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian Authority. Our organisation has been targeted, but we're still operational, pushing for the basic right of Palestinians to live in dignity.”\\nBut even the western-backed PA, widely criticised by many Palestinians for its role in working closely with the Israeli occupation, has been excluded from discussions about Gaza's future. That's largely down to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli ministers who have firmly ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza.\\n“What we have now is a propped-up dictator, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected in 2005 for a four-year period that has now stretched for more than 20 years. He has been kept in power by outside support, not popular support. And now, even this propped-up leadership is not being consulted on what kind of leadership or governance should exist; let alone … the Palestinian community itself, the people who are going through the genocide right now,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe work continues\\nFor Al-Aboudi, the denial of Palestinian agency has been a process that has unfolded over many decades.\\nIn 2021, Israel designated Bisan Centre and five other human rights organisations in the occupied territories as terrorists. This was widely rebuffed by the international community.\\n“Israel has always worked to stifle any kind of Palestinian agency … We have always been subjected to Israeli harassment.” But he explained that the sucker punch was landed when the Israeli government designated Bisan under the same label as al-Qaida and Islamic State. “Can you imagine that? Civil society organisations that write reports, provide aid for people, provide legal counselling, communicate to the world, to the UN, what is happening here, are being treated in the same way as IS?” Al-Aboudi said.\\nYet the work continues. “We believe in every human being in the world. We believe in equality, we believe in dignity, and we believe our people deserve it like any other people around the world.”\\nWith the Palestinians living amid one of their darkest chapters in their history, I asked Al-Aboudi why he still holds on to hope.\\n“This is the only thing that keeps us going … When we see millions of people on the streets of London or Manchester, or in Sydney, Australia … this gives us hope. We know that righteousness is on our side. We know that the people of the world feel for what we are going through,” he said.\\nAnd, he added, that regardless of what is being planned in backrooms, he ultimately believes that political agency will, at the end of the day, lie with the people. “The people have the power, and the people can claim back their political agency from corrupt governments and businesses.”\\nPatrick Greenfield has a fascinating look at the genuinely serious work of tackling invasive hornets threatening UK pollinators.

After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete picture of the event. This documentary series on iPlayer, copes with the challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform's layout to give us the fullest picture possible. The shocking story is skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors' words, as the actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their experience. Jack Seale\\nMusicBlood Orange: Essex Honey | ★★★★★This is an exquisitely eclectic portrait of grief. It combines gorgeous melodies with dancefloor rhythms, indie pop and languorous funk – and cameos from Lorde and Zadie Smith. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there's a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes's mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London's urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on countryside. Alexis Petridis\\nFilmIn the Nguyen Kitchen | ★★★★☆In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen. A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can't help but dream in songs. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Phuong Le\\nTheatreJuniper Blood (Donmar Warehouse, London) | ★★★☆☆Mike Bartlett's invigorating play is a drama about whether it is possible to live responsibly in our age of toxic capitalism. It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.

That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.” \\nLate on Tuesday, a senior UN official warned that expanding Israeli military operations inside the territory “would risk catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza”.\\nAddressing the UN security council in New York, Miroslav Jenča, the assistant secretary general for Europe, central Asia and the Americas, said: “There is no military solution to the conflict in Gaza or the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”\\nChina's deputy UN representative, Geng Shuang, expressed “great concern” about the reported plans for Gaza and added: “We urge Israel to immediately halt such dangerous actions.” He called for a ceasefire and urged countries with influence to take concrete steps to help bring one about.\\nIsrael's scorched-earth campaign has obliterated large parts of Gaza, killed more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forced nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people from their homes and created what a global hunger monitor last week called an unfolding famine.\\nThat has caused widespread international anger and prompted the UK to say it would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against Israel. Several other European countries including Portugal and Finland have recently signed a statement declaring their willingness to recognize the state of Palestine as an essential step towards a two-state solution.\\nThe disquiet follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion.\\n“The die has been cast. We're going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu.\\nBy Tuesday, however, evidence had emerged of deep splits between Netanyahu and senior military officials, including the chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who reportedly voiced opposition to the plan, prompting calls for his dismissal.\\nAbsent at a security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu did, however, meet security officials, but not in a decision-making setting. His office said later that the Israeli military would carry out any decision made in cabinet. \\nDuring a visit to an army training facility earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “It is necessary to complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, to free all our hostages and to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.”\\nMilitary analysts in the Israeli media, channelling some defence officials, were also sceptical. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the military affairs commentator Yossi Yehoshua described the risks of the proposal. “Hostages … will die, large numbers of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers will be killed as well as a serious logistical problem – where to house the roughly 1 million civilians who are now in Gaza City.\\n“Currently, Israel simply doesn't have legitimacy either to continue to fight in Gaza or to establish a city of refugees on its ruins.”\\nIsraeli officials have said Netanyahu discussed a plan with the White House as it attempted to portray Hamas as having walked away from ceasefire negotiations, a claim denied by Hamas, which blamed Israel for the protracted impasse.\\nWhile the Trump administration has not commented on the Netanyahu proposal, it has been given some credence by leaked comments made by the US envoy Steve Witkoff to Israeli hostage families at the weekend, suggesting his proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining living hostages had failed.\\nWitkoff added that Donald Trump “now believes that everybody should come home at once. No piecemeal deals,” adding they were now pursuing an “all or nothing” plan.\\nAt the centre of the Netanyahu plan is the notion that, by surrounding areas where hostages are believed to be held, Israeli forces can raid those areas and rescue the captives, a policy that has broadly failed during the past two years of war.\\nAmid questions over the practicality of a wider offensive, some have speculated that Netanyahu's call may be more rhetorical than real in substance, aimed at keeping onboard far-right ministers who have demanded they be allowed to build settlements in Gaza.\\nA Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.\\n“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” the official told Reuters, requesting not to be named.\\nPractically, too, it is unclear whether Israel has the capacity for the kind of expanded operation described.\\nThe IDF has struggled with manpower issues as the war drags on, with reservists being repeatedly called up amid concerns over a mental health crisis that has included a number of suicides.\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"Good morning. Parliament has returned from its summer recess. MPs are filing back into those hallowed halls to resume the business of running the country. Have you missed them? Judging by polling on trust in politicians, the answer from many of you is likely a resounding no.\\nFor most MPs, the summer recess is a chance to pause and reset. Not so for Reform UK. The insurgent party, which has just four MPs, spent the summer working the country like it was in the middle of a general election campaign. It has been hard to escape Nigel Farage (pictured top) and Reform: the party has held at least five press conferences since recess began (with another scheduled for today). There has also been a flurry of statements and open letters, and record-breaking polling to top it all off. Reform returns to parliament riding high.\\nThe ball is now in Labour's court. With a packed autumn schedule, the government has an opportunity to reset the news cycle and seize the political agenda. But, just because it can, does not mean that it will.\\nLabour has been widely criticised for failing to articulate a message that cuts through in its first year in power. Can that change this autumn? What challenges lie ahead and where might the party finally break through? To explore all this and more, I spoke to the Guardian's political editor, Pippa Crerar. That's after the headlines.\\nAfghanistan | At least 250 people were dead and hundreds more injured in a magnitude 6 earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border. The quake was centred 27km north-east of the city of Jalalabad.\\nIsrael-Gaza war | Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 18 people in and around Gaza City, local health authorities said, as Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet prepared to discuss plans to seize the city.\\nConservatives | Doubts have surfaced over Kemi Badenoch's claim to have been offered a place at a prestigious US medical school at 16, with admissions staff unable to recall the proposal and the university not providing the course.\\nUK news | A police officer was allegedly punched in the face and four people were arrested at an anti-immigration protest march in London on Sunday.\\nHeart disease | Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines worldwide.\\nLabour did not head into summer recess from a position of strength. The party was forced into a humiliating retreat over its welfare reform bill after a dramatic backbench rebellion. After weeks of bruising infighting, many in Labour felt the summer break offered a chance to cool tempers and rethink. They may come to regret that.\\n“They could have managed to allow everyone a break without vacating the public arena for Reform and they may rue the day that they allowed Reform to set the agenda,” Pippa Crerar told me. “It makes it harder now to refute the claims that they don't have a grip on migration and it means that they have to think quite carefully about how to get back on to the front foot.”\\nStill, the Labour government is determined to wrest back control, and they will have plenty of opportunity to do so: with a packed autumn of domestic challenges and international crises, the public will be looking to hear directly from those in power.\\n“Whether they managed to get the positive message that they want to get across is a totally different question and obviously a much harder feat. People I've spoken to in Downing Street and in government suggest that they understand they need to do that, and there's a degree of frustration that delivery's not fast enough and the messaging isn't coherent enough,” Pippa said.\\nThere has been a flurry of reports that Keir Starmer (pictured above) is preparing a minor reshuffle of his government, alongside changes to his Downing Street team.\\n“Ultimately, the buck stops with the person at the top,” Pippa said. “And if the person at the top isn't able to articulate why they want to be in government and what they want to achieve in a way that resonates with ordinary people, it's a struggle.”\\nSo what problems lie ahead for the government, at home and on the international stage? \\n***\\nThe domestic challenges …\\nRecent polling makes for an uncomfortable read for Labour supporters. The party enjoyed little in the way of a honeymoon period, with figures showing its ratings have fallen further in the first 10 months of government than those of any other party in modern history.\\nBut Pippa told me that the polling, which has been brutal for the Conservatives as well, shows widespread discontent with mainstream politics generally.\\n“Reform is doing so well because it capitalises on that discontent, it becomes a vehicle for the disillusionment which many people have in the mainstream political parties,” Pippa said. “And Farage is an extraordinary communicator who manages to tap into people's fears, just as he did with Brexit, to provide answers that I would argue exacerbates them, particularly with migration.”\\nOn migration, Labour are breathing a sigh of relief to have won an appeal to continue using hotels to house asylums seekers, but the fight is far from over. The party are working to reduce the asylum backlog, having announced their agreement of a one in, one out deal with the French, but it's slow work, Pippa explained. For MPs in marginal seats, particularly around the “red wall”, they fear migration is the issue that could cost them unless the government is tougher.\\nThe European convention on human rights (ECHR) is the new battleground, with Farage describing it as such. “Downing Street has made it absolutely clear that the UK was not going to leave the ECHR, because it would be hugely problematic for things like trade deals and, crucially, the Good Friday agreement,” Pippa said. But the government has announced a review of article 8 (respect for your private and family life) of the EHRC and possibly article 3 (protecting you from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), as there are arguments that their scope is too wide and they are preventing the deportation of convicted foreign criminals.\\nThere's a broader debate on whether the UK should work with European Union member states on more general reforms of the ECHR as a whole.\\nThe other big domestic challenge is the economy. “Rachel Reeves is ending the summer in a worse position than she started,” Pippa said, with inflation remaining high, many still struggling with the cost of living crisis, and the Office for Budget Responsibility now thinking of revising its forecast in light of an outdated measure of productivity.\\n“The problem it creates for Reeves, and the reason I think we are likely to see the budget potentially pushed back into November from October, is that they're trying to work out the communications on it. They have boxed themselves in. They said that they are not going to borrow any more and they said that they don't want to be a government that cuts spending. Well, that only leaves them with tax rises,” Pippa said.\\n***\\n… And the international upheavals\\nThe problem for Starmer is that his international popularity isn't translating much domestically. But why is his reputation better among international audiences? Pippa told me Starmer has built a reputation for being effective in difficult situations with international partners.\\n“The big international moment coming up in the next month is Donald Trump's state visit. And, as we saw when Trump was on a holiday in Scotland, he has this capacity to whirl into town and stir everything up and then disappear again. He's a very unpredictable president,” Pippa said.\\nDespite Trump's promises to end the war in Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin has continued ordering attacks (including a deadly assault on Kyiv last week). And the Alaska summit didn't deliver what Ukraine and its European partners wanted, Pippa said.\\nOn Gaza, Starmer has promised to recognise Palestine as a state, after being urged to do so by his cabinet and the wider Labour movement. But as the devastation continues in Gaza and the siege is tightened across the rest of the occupied Palestinian territories, pressure grows on Starmer to go further, with growing calls for further sanctions.\\n“They've already sanctioned the two far right members of Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet. We could well see more to come,” Pippa said. “The government has certainly indicated that they would be prepared to take further steps and sanction not only just politicians but also senior Israeli military, if they think that they've been directly responsible for some of their atrocities in Gaza.”\\n***\\nAn existential moment for Keir Starmer\\nStarmer clearly drew out the battle line when he labelled Reform as the main opposition to his government. But over the last few months there has been a real risk of Starmer being defined by Farage. So how will Labour respond?\\n“The big danger is that personal attacks on Farage put the spotlight on him and give him a platform. By defining him as the opposition, it cuts the Tories off at the knees, but it also risks putting Reform UK in a better position,” Pippa said. “If the government sees Reform as a potential government in waiting, then presumably the public may as well.”\\nAnd we saw this summer what happens when Farage is left unchallenged. “They will take the fight to him.,” Pippa said of Labour. But whether they do that by moving in to Reform UK's terrain, or by managing to make the case for their own agenda based on Labour values and on what Starmer believes in will be the interesting thing to watch, she added.\\nThe problem for voters is that many just don't know what the PM stands for. “Starmer has struggled to articulate what he believes in, so this is an existential moment if they can't turn the tide away from Reform UK and can't convince people that Labour can actually deliver,” Pippa said, pointing to next May's local elections, as well as votes in Wales and Scotland, as critical moments. And, by next summer, Labour will be halfway through its parliamentary term.\\nBut, Pippa added, Reform's lead in the polls does not make an election win a foregone conclusion, and Labour still have time on their side. She described Reform's policies as vague and contradictory. While Farage has been able to capitalise on exploiting social and racial divisions, many British people may not feel comfortable with the direction he represents.\\n“We live in incredibly volatile times,” Pippa said, “But it does definitely still feel like there's everything to play for for Labour”.\\nUnfortunate enough to have heard about the “performative male”, the internet's new least favourite type of guy?

Until tomorrow.\\nQuick crossword\\nCryptic crossword\\nWordiply\", \"Good morning. Angela Rayner's decision to step down will be a gut punch for the prime minister, who went out of his way to defend her.\\nIt was an unlikely political marriage – while Keir Starmer is known for his sober style, Rayner is emotionally open and forthright. But for that reason it was also a union that Starmer desperately relied on, and it leaves a gaping hole for Labour.\\nAside from dealing with the fallout and subsequent big cabinet reshuffle, Starmer's in-tray is already full, with his break this summer in Europe probably already feeling like a decade ago.\\nLabour has been bruised by its failure to get to grips with the surging threat from the far right (stoked by Nigel Farage over the summer) and is struggling to put forward a credible plan for the economy. I spoke to Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee about thorns in Starmer's side: losing Rayner, his inability to get Farage off his heels, and what to do about the country's finances at the upcoming budget. That's after the headlines.\\nPolitics | Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, will host a meeting of the Five Eyes security alliance to discuss how to stop people-smuggling.\\nUK news | Almost 900 people were arrested at a demonstration in central London on Saturday against the banning of the protest group Palestine Action.\\nUkraine | Russia has launched its largest ever air attack on Ukraine, hitting a key government building in Kyiv for the first time and killing at least three people.\\nAustralia | Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 33 years after murdering three people and attempting to murder a fourth with a lunch laced with death cap mushrooms.\\nNew Zealand| A fugitive father who had been hiding in New Zealand's rugged wilderness with his three children for nearly four years has been shot dead by police investigating an armed burglary in which a police officer was shot and badly wounded.\\nOn Friday Rayner resigned after the prime minister's ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code over her underpayment of stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat. Her departure leaves the government without one of its most authentic working-class voices at a time when it is struggling to reconnect with its traditional voter base. In what is likely to prove a bittersweet moment, her workers' rights bill is due to pass its final stage soon.\\nRayner has been an emblem of social mobility. “It's an absolute tragedy for Labour to lose her,” says Polly Toynbee. “She was representative of something quite different in the cabinet – not just that she's working class because this is a very working-class cabinet – but the way she came up without a university education, unmarried mother of a disabled child aged 16. Her backstory is so extraordinary. But more than that, she was such a blazingly bright character. You would see her singing and dancing at party conferences. She was fun, she was human, and she was full of indignation about injustices of every kind.”\\nRayner was the first to pile the pressure on Conservative party chair Nadhim Zahawi when the issue over his tax affairs was first revealed in 2023. She did the same with Jeremy Hunt in 2018. “The trouble is, that's what's done it for her, because there are so many quotes of her being outraged by the rich not paying their taxes, or other people not playing the game fairly. That's really finished her off. What she's done herself – whether it was by accident or on purpose, who knows – is a complete calamity,” says Polly.\\nStarmer has been told by senior Labour figures he must stop making mistakes. The mood within the party is “pretty ferocious” after achieving a stonking great majority with nothing in its way, and then such an appalling first year, says Polly. Rayner's departure sparked a big cabinet reshuffle, with David Lammy made deputy prime minister and Yvette Cooper made foreign secretary. Only a handful of cabinet ministers stayed in the same job (including Wes Streeting at health and Rachel Reeves as chancellor).\\nThe number of cabinet changes suggests the extent of worry, with a feeling that there needed to be a complete reset within No 10, with Labour continuing to disappoint in the polls as Reform UK's successes pile up (although a No 1 single may yet elude them). \\nOn a personal level, Starmer was clearly sad to see Rayner go and said in his response to her resignation letter that she had been “a true friend for many years”. He said: “I have nothing but admiration for you and huge respect for your achievements in politics.” The letter was, unusually, written by hand.\\n***\\nManaging the surge from the right\\nA YouGov poll last month put Labour on just 20% of public approval, eight points behind Reform UK and its lowest level in more than five years. While everyone else was on sunloungers for summer recess, Farage spotted an opportunity to get some attention with a series of press conferences for journalists hungry for news, whipping up anger about the rising number of small boat crossings, and hotels housing asylum seekers.\\nPolly says the public's appetite to reduce immigration will never be fully sated. “I think there will always be some people who want more and more foreigners out, and it comes and goes in waves.” But Farage doesn't have much else to campaign on, said Polly.\\nAnd his ideas don't generally hold under scrutiny. For example, when asked for clarification on his pledge to pay the Taliban for taking shipments of refugees, he changed the subject. And speaking at the Reform UK conference in Birmingham, Farage declared he will run on a pledge to “stop the boats” within two weeks of entering No 10, which he quickly rowed back on.\\nMuch to the discomfort of the left, immigration is now considered one of the most important issues for voters – which is why getting a grip on Britain's borders, and showing visible progress on this issue, is one of the most pressing things in Starmer's in-tray. Farage was eager to trumpet a general election in 2027 – although something truly extraordinary would need to happen for that to occur given the size of Labour's majority.\\nFollowing Reform UK's conference over the weekend, the government made announcements about speeding up the closure of asylum hotels and suspending refugee family reunions. Starmer has been criticised for peddling populist narratives, recently warning that Britain had become an “island of strangers” – though later blaming his Enoch Powell-esque language on his speechwriters.\\nPolly says Starmer needs to completely change tack and attack Farage's views, rather than placating him. “In every speech, he has to go for his racism, he has to go for his stirring up race hatred and hatred against foreigners, the terrible incidents of people being attacked, like the deputy leader of the Greens, on the beach at Cromer, with his family of Asian origin having bottles and insults thrown at them.”\\nPopulations are declining across Europe, projections show, creating economic shocks and slower growth, which will be exacerbated without immigration. So Polly says Starmer should make a stronger case for the benefits of immigration.\\n“We need these people. Look around you and you see how much we need migrants with the skills that we need … you can turn it into a different conversation,” she says.\\n***\\nCan Starmer win economic credibility?\\nA major political event this autumn is the budget.\\nIt has already been delayed, sparking speculation about the size of the fiscal deficit and how it can be plugged, with Rachel Reeves acknowledging that the UK economy is “not working well enough for working people”. She said: “Bills are high. Getting ahead feels tougher. You put more in, get less out. That has to change.”\\nExperts suggest the spending gap is likely to reach more than £40bn after sluggish economic growth and higher-than-expected inflation. Reeves has already ruled out putting up income tax, national insurance or VAT, in order to stick with her manifesto pledges. Options include increasing inheritance tax and raising capital gains tax on expensive homes.\\nCoupled with her struggle to explain tax rises to the public, she also needs to improve public services. She must manage demands for higher pay for public sector staff, deal with the doctors' strike and oversee the phase-out of NHS England.\\nOne option in her arsenal would be to “remind citizens that their taxes pay for things that we value”, says Polly.\\n“[They should] say, look, if you want public services that are up to standard, you have to pay for them. There is no free lunch. These are hard times right across Europe. Donald Trump has made them much worse … When it comes to it, I know most of the people in this country would rather have a health service, local council services that work and pay a bit more tax, than to have tax cuts and threadbare services on their knees,” she says.\\nOf course, the party might be afraid of big business, but as Polly says: “There's no point in trying to do quite ‘left' things and sort of whispering about it. Business is never going to like Labour very much, but I think there would be more respect if they spell out what they're about and why.”\\nThe tendency of some landlords to police their tenants' behaviour is well documented, but adverts from prospective flatmates stipulating absurd house-sharing rules are increasingly common and speak to something deeper about rising housing inequality.

Fortunately, we in the UK couldn't wish for a better-qualified prime minister to face this challenge. Keir Starmer is a distinguished former human rights lawyer and prosecutor, with a 30-year career behind him, who expresses a deep personal commitment to defending ordinary people against injustice. He knows human rights law inside out – in fact, he literally wrote the book on its European incarnation – and has acted as a lawyer at more or less every level of the system. (Starmer is the only British prime minister, and probably the only world leader, to have argued a case under the genocide convention – against Serbia on behalf of Croatia in 2014 – at the international court of justice.) He is also an experienced administrator, through his time as director of public prosecutions (DPP), which means he knows how to operate the machinery of state better than most politicians do.\\nUnfortunately, there's someone standing in Starmer's way: a powerful man who critics say is helping to weaken the international human rights system. He fawns over authoritarian demagogues abroad and is seeking to diminish the protections the UK offers to some vulnerable minorities. He conflates peaceful, if disruptive, protest with deadly terrorism and calls for musicians whose views and language he dislikes to be dropped from festival bills. At times, he uses his public platform to criticise courts, whose independence is vital to maintaining the human rights system. At others, he uses legal sophistry to avoid openly stating and defending his own political position, including on matters of life and death. He is, even some of his admirers admit, a ruthless careerist prepared to jettison his stated principles when politically expedient. That person is also called Keir Starmer.\\nSince the 2024 general election, much ink has been spilled on what Labour is getting wrong in government. But I've been puzzled by a slightly different question: why is Labour's record to date on human rights – the one thing you might expect a Starmer-led government to be rock solid on – so mixed? Over the past six months, I have spoken to more than two dozen sources, including current and former Labour insiders, former legal colleagues of Starmer's and leading human rights advocates, to try to understand how Starmer the lawyer might be shaping Starmer the prime minister.\\nSome human rights experts are delighted that, after the scorched-earth years of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, there has been a shift in tone and content. “It is a major achievement,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics and long-term acquaintance of Starmer, “to have stabilised Britain's commitment to law at a time when the current is flowing the other way internationally.” For the author, barrister and academic Philippe Sands, a prominent critic of the 2003 Iraq war, the UK is belatedly restoring a reputation it shredded two decades ago. “When I've gone to meetings in the UN, when I've gone to meetings in the Council of Europe, I've seen that Britain is once more taken seriously in relation to building a more positive agenda on human rights.” Sands is particularly encouraged by Labour's commitment to setting up a special tribunal for Russian war crimes in Ukraine, despite the US's wavering support. Such achievements, Sands and Gearty believe, are in no small part down to Starmer himself. “He does well in a crisis,” says a senior barrister who worked on several cases with Starmer in the 2000s. “That's what litigators do: they enter the fray at the moment of complete crisis and shitshow.”\\nOthers, to put it mildly, aren't so keen. Before the election, Starmer told a meeting of Iranian women activists that a Labour government would put human rights at the heart of everything it did. “That's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard,” says a campaigner at a UK charity who regularly meets with ministers and officials. The campaigner reeled off a list of complaints, from policies on migration, policing and protest, to disability benefit cuts and a failure to push harder for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Some former colleagues are shocked that Starmer presides over all this. “Given he made his career off a woman who constantly scaled the fences of US bases,” says the criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, referring to Lindis Percy, a veteran peace activist Starmer represented several times in the 1990s and 00s, “what he's doing on protest is particularly sickening.”\\nStaff at several human rights NGOs described encountering a brittle, defensive attitude from ministers in private meetings. “They think the human rights community should put up and shut up,” said one. “There's a tone as if our agenda is against the interests of UK citizens,” said another, who focuses on international issues. “The line that comes back is that this is irrelevant to ordinary people's concerns.” All said that this attitude emanated most strongly from officials working for the prime minister, an interpretation echoed by two people familiar with cabinet-level conversations. Several human rights advocates described being made to feel they should just be grateful it was Labour and not the Tories in charge.\\nHow to explain, then, what Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, described to me as this “split personality approach”? Some government insiders complain about a lack of overall strategy and an insular, macho “boys' club” surrounding Starmer – frequent criticisms of Labour in recent months – while the human rights advocates I spoke to say some officials are inexperienced. Much of the answer, however, surely resides with Starmer himself, and his own ambiguous politics.\\nThere are three Starmer biographies to date, each with a very different perspective. One is a critique from the left, one from the right and one, with his input, very positive. Yet all three books tell roughly the same story. Starmer started off on the radical left, as a talented young barrister, but tacked towards the centre as his career progressed and his political ambitions grew, becoming DPP – helping run what a former colleague described to me as “the really nasty parts of the state” – before entering politics.\\nAs an MP, he ran for Labour leader on a leftwing platform and then moved sharply rightwards; depending on your political preference, either a smart strategic move, or what Simon Fletcher, who was a senior adviser to Starmer in his first year as leader of the opposition, told me he now views as a “massive, massive con”. He eschews ideology – “there's no such thing as Starmerism and there never will be. I will make decisions one after the other,” Starmer reportedly told colleagues while leader of the opposition – and his detail-focused lawyer's mind leads him to make effective, short-term tactical choices, but also blinds him to the wider consequences of his actions.\\n“He can be very tunnel-visioned,” concedes the senior barrister who praised his skills in a crisis, adding that on occasion it leads Starmer the politician to make statements that any lawyer would find “frankly, weird”. (Starmer's assertion during an interview in October 2023 that Israel “has the right” to cut off water and electricity to Gaza – acts that are clearly war crimes – and his subsequent backtracking is the notorious example.) This pattern has continued into government. “He keeps blindsiding people,” says the head of one UK charity, pointing to the sudden decision in February to cut international aid. (“That really was a case of, ‘Oh shit, we need to find £2bn for defence,'” one government official told me.)\\nThis isn't just about Starmer, though. Human rights represent an idea with revolutionary implications: that we all have the right to freedom and dignity, wherever we live, and that it is everyone's business to make sure of it. This goal is yet to be fully realised and the project to achieve it is riven with contradictions – the same contradictions, in fact, that we find in the two faces of Starmer. “Is he the man to save the system?” asks another former colleague. “That depends on what you think the system is.”\\nIn 2020, Starmer told Desert Island Discs what had attracted him to human rights as a law student in the 1980s. “I became absolutely fascinated with the idea that at the end of the second world war, and the atrocities of the second world war, the countries around the world came together and made commitments to each other to honour human rights,” he said. “It's not so much the individual rights, but it's the human dignity that sits behind [them].”\\nNow, is that a radical sentiment, or a conservative one? In a way, it's both. A tension within the human rights project is that it cuts across traditional political distinctions of left and right. The founding principles, outlined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stress both individual freedom and socioeconomic equality. What's more, human rights have an ambiguous relationship to the state. On the one hand, the claim that rights exist due to our common humanity, no matter who's in charge, implies a challenge to established power. On the other, it reinforces existing power structures – since the human rights system only works if national governments agree to respect the rules. And to make those rules work in practice, you need laws, courts and an elite group of technicians who know how to work the levers: in other words, lawyers.\\nTraditionally, the British left was sceptical of the postwar human rights project, seeing it as a distraction from class struggle – and a tool the right could use to prevent any socialist government from redistributing wealth, on the grounds of individual liberty. When Starmer was starting out as a lawyer, co-founding the progressive Doughty Street barristers' chambers in 1990, he expressed a similar scepticism. In a 1991 article for the radical Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers – of which he was a prominent member – Starmer warned that relying on legal institutions to bring about social change was “putting the cart before the horse”.\\nThe collapse of communism abroad and Thatcher's victory over organised labour at home prompted a change in attitudes. After the 1992 election, the Labour party committed to introducing a bill that would incorporate human rights protections into UK law. Writing in 1995, Starmer welcomed the prospect. “Our task, as socialist lawyers,” he argued, was to begin drafting a document that would bring about “an equal … distribution not only of political power, but also of economic power.” The following year, Starmer co-authored an audit of the UK's compliance with international human rights standards, an influential book in Labour circles as Blair's team drew up their plans for government.\\nBy the time of the 1997 election, Starmer was a rising legal star. His rightwing biographer Michael Ashcroft places him at the centre of the elite professional milieu that rose along with New Labour. Many progressive lawyers welcomed the arrival of the Human Rights Act, passed in 1998, amid the modernising first flush of Blairism. Phillippa Kaufmann, a leading human rights barrister and an ex-partner of Starmer's, told Starmer's favoured biographer, Tom Baldwin, that it felt as if they were “driving forward the vehicle of change”. Starmer, who in 2002 was made queen's counsel, or QC – the highest rank of barrister, now KC – added the act to his already formidable arsenal of expertise. In 2003, he represented a group of asylum-seekers who successfully challenged the government's attempt to deny them housing and benefit payments; a few years later, he helped overturn control orders (restrictions on the movement and liberty of terrorism suspects, introduced by Blair) that had been placed on two men. Both sets of cases were won on human rights grounds.\\nIt's not possible to read a barrister's list of cases as an index of their political opinions, since barristers – whose job is to argue in court on behalf of their clients – operate by the “cab rank” rule, where they must offer their services on a first come, first served basis. But by the areas of law in which they choose to specialise, it is possible to see where their interests lie. Starmer's interest clearly lay in protecting individuals from being harmed by the state and other powerful institutions. (One of his longest-running cases, for which he provided free legal advice, was that of the McLibel duo, environmentalist campaigners sued by McDonald's.) What that meant politically changed over time, however.\\nIn the early 00s, Starmer chose to advise the Northern Ireland Policing Board on how to make the Police Service of Northern Ireland, established after the Good Friday agreement, compliant with human rights standards. That work seemed to represent a shift in his view of the state. Rather than seeing it as an adversary that serves mainly to protect wealth and privilege, as a radical leftist might put it, according to Baldwin he was coming to believe that a human rights lawyer could work most effectively on the inside. By making the state's coercive functions compliant with human rights standards, they could be exercised more efficiently, and thus fairly.\\nAs DPP from 2008 to 2013, Starmer brought a fundamentally bureaucratic approach to the role, say his biographers. One of his proudest achievements, he has said, was overseeing his agency's transition from paper to digital record-keeping. Even Starmer's critics acknowledge that making top-down tweaks to the rules had some benefits. The criminal defence solicitor Matt Foot, for instance, told me that Starmer's guidance to prosecutors advising a light touch on assisted dying cases averted a lot of unnecessary suffering. “I had several clients at police stations who weren't charged as a result,” he said.\\nAt other times, notably during the 2011 riots, Starmer was comfortable using the full force of the state – a fact that his leftwing biographer, Oliver Eagleton, takes him to task for. Whether Starmer was right or wrong to do so is another matter. But it's consistent with a particular interpretation of what human rights are there for. “I don't think there's a hidden emancipatory human rights fanatic inside Keir Starmer,” Gearty told me. Starmer decided to work within the state “because he understood the importance of the rules”.\\nA second tension within the human rights system is that it requires the cooperation of national governments, yet asks them to sign up to agreements that restrain their power. In the UK, that tension expresses itself most strongly in the political battle over the European convention on human rights and, by extension, the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the ECHR into UK law. Together, they are intended to restrain the government and other public bodies from arbitrarily mistreating us.\\nA vocal section of the British right has long sought to weaken or remove these protections. But in the last few years it has become a totemic issue akin to Britain's membership of the EU before Brexit: withdrawing from the ECHR would, they say, take back control from a set of rules – and the liberal elite that upholds them – that are undermining national sovereignty. In particular, the right's opprobrium is directed at article 8, the right to a private and family life, which it claims forces the British state to let unwanted migrants live in the UK.\\nGiven Starmer's background, you would expect his government to be solidly opposed to this assault on human rights – and in a way, it has been. Among the first things Starmer did as prime minister was to state publicly that his government would never withdraw from the ECHR, one of several gestures intended to signal the incoming government's commitment to international treaties and the rule of law.\\nHuman rights NGOs agree that the shift in approach has changed things, up to a point. “There's a marked difference in the way I engage with this government compared with the last one,” says Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, who regularly meets with ministers and officials to discuss international and domestic policy. “They're willing to sit down and have thoughtful conversations about human rights issues.” The trouble, says Ahmed, is that this generally only extends to subjects the government sees as politically safe, such as the humanitarian crisis prompted by the war in Sudan. When her organisation raises more politically risky topics, such as migration or the Gaza war, then the government's response, especially at higher levels, is much more limited.\\nIn March, under pressure from the right, Starmer's government announced a review of how article 8 is used in immigration cases. Several human rights experts told me they believed this lent weight to a damaging myth that would, in the words of one campaigner at a human rights NGO, “pour fuel on the fire”. Jamie Burton, a senior barrister and a former colleague of Starmer's at Doughty Street, told me that ceding ground on article 8 – which also protects British citizens, for example, from unwanted media intrusion – would be a “lose-lose scenario”. In a recent article, Burton argued that the use of article 8 has already been so heavily restricted in immigration cases that any further tweaks would be useless and only encourage demands for the UK to drop it entirely. Dominic Grieve, a former Conservative attorney general, told me that in his view, attention would be better focused on delays in the courts system rather than article 8 itself. The delays, he said, were “not helpful to maintaining public confidence in the ECHR”.\\nGrieve, who as attorney general oversaw Starmer as DPP, told me he was confident in the prime minister's commitment to human rights. For many lawyers, however – regardless of their personal views on policy – it is Starmer's own rhetoric that has been most upsetting. Notably, at a session of prime minister's questions in February 2025, Starmer said that a court had made the “wrong decision” to allow a family of six trying to flee Gaza to join their brother in the UK, based on a “legal loophole”. Whether the decision was based on any kind of loophole is questionable: a judge found that while they had applied under the Ukraine resettlement scheme, for which they were ineligible, they nonetheless had the right to reunite with their brother under article 8. But many lawyers were appalled that Starmer, of all people, would criticise the decision of an independent court. “For him to criticise a judge as prime minister with his background was extraordinary,” another KC who worked with Starmer in the 00s told me. (At the time, in response to the criticism – including from Lady Carr, the most senior judge in England and Wales – a spokesperson for Starmer said he had full respect for the independence of the judiciary.)\\nStarmer's rhetoric can be explained as the government's response to the rise of Reform UK. “They're expecting a further Tory wipeout, so the next election will be Starmer v Farage,” one person familiar with cabinet-level discussions told me. “That's the explicit strategy. But what's not explicit is what that means for the postwar settlement and human rights, all these knock-on effects.” The source continued: “If you're more on the left of that debate, if you're David Lammy or Angela Rayner or Lisa Nandy, you don't want to stick your hand up in cabinet and say, have we thought about where this is heading – because you'll get a combination of Morgan McSweeney, John Healey and Pat McFadden [respectively, Starmer's chief of staff and two cabinet ministers] saying, ‘What the fuck are you talking about?'” Both the source and another person familiar with cabinet-level discussions said that ministers whose views differ also fear being anonymously briefed against in the media.\\nThe real problem, both added, is that you never know where Starmer himself sits. As if to illustrate the point, in May the current attorney general, Richard Hermer – appointed by Starmer last July – gave a major speech on the government's commitment to the rule of law. For the most part, it was a strongly worded critique of the “pseudo-realists” in Westminster who argue that the old global order is dead and that Britain should withdraw from the ECHR and other treaties it finds inconvenient. It was a notable intervention, since Hermer, another former human rights barrister, has become a lightning rod for the right's critique of the Starmer government.\\nIn an echo of the attacks once deployed against Starmer when he was leader of the opposition, Hermer's critics have been dredging up his old cases to cast aspersions on his politics. (The most lurid stunt so far involves a video in which the Conservative shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, parades in front of easels showing pictures of Hermer's former clients, including Shamima Begum and Gerry Adams.) Hermer has been briefed against from within Labour, too, by officials who believe his professional background and insistence that ministers follow legal advice closely are damaging the party's image. But Starmer has, for now, kept his attorney general in post. “Starmer has put Hermer there to keep himself honest,” suggested one Labour strategist I spoke to.\\nIn that context, it was tempting to see Hermer's speech as a sign of Starmer's own worldview. Within hours, however, Hermer found himself at the centre of yet more criticism, for suggesting the “pseudo-realists” were borrowing their ideas from the 20th-century German jurist Carl Schmitt. In scholarly circles, Schmitt's conservative ideas are widely discussed – but he's better known for being the Nazis' favourite legal theorist. A day later, Downing Street ordered Hermer to apologise.\\nFor some people I spoke to, this showed one of Starmer's wider weaknesses: he is committed to following the letter of the law, but unwilling to take the risk of arguing for the underlying principles. “Over the last 10 to 15 years, human rights have almost become dirty words,” said Karla McLaren, political relations manager for Amnesty International's UK branch. “We were hoping the new government would come in and try to change that. But that's not what we've seen. If you look at what cabinet ministers say, even when they're talking about human rights issues, they very rarely use human rights language.”\\nOne person familiar with cabinet-level conversations made a similar point, in reference to the ECHR. “We've allowed the right to define the issue. It does seem baffling to me that we keep attacking a bunch of laws that are very much in our interest, and probably more in our interest than for some other countries.”\\nA third tension in the human rights system is that it requires powerful states to enforce it, yet is undermined by an unequal global distribution of power. If states can pick and choose who is held accountable for human rights abuses, then it makes a mockery of the claim these rights are universal – and gives other states less of an incentive to participate. Nowhere has this become more apparent than in the west's response to the war in Gaza, an issue that, as one official put it to me, “people have lots of very strong views about”.\\nTo date, in its response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel has killed at least 59,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch – NGOs whose reports are regularly cited by lawyers in Starmer's former specialism – are among those who say Israel is committing genocide. (Both also say that Hamas committed war crimes on 7 October, including hostage-taking and the murder of civilians.) Yet Israel has been able to pursue its military action relatively unhindered thanks to support from its allies: the UK, certainly, but most of all the US, its principal military, financial and political backer.\\nAs the dominant global power since 1945, the US played a significant role in shaping the human rights system (Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady, was a driving force behind the Universal Declaration) but its commitment to that system has been patchy. “You didn't have to be super radical to think that the international legal order was designed for the west,” Gearty told me, but in years gone by “you could slightly pretend it wasn't”. The west's support of Israel's war, he believes, has made the imbalance impossible to ignore.\\nSince taking office, Labour has tried to tread a fine line on Israel, between being seen to abide by international law, and continuing to support an ally it says has the right to defend itself from Hamas and hostile states such as Iran. At the same time, it has been keen not to upset the US, particularly since Trump took office. According to the two people familiar with cabinet-level discussions, there are disagreements in government about how best to approach this, analogous to the divisions over how to deal with Reform UK – a “dog-eat-dog” worldview, as one put it, versus a more humanitarian-minded one. Both positions are generally supportive of Israel, said the other source, but differ on people's “relative strength of support for Netanyahu”.\\nAs ever, it's not clear exactly where the prime minister sits. But as Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire report in their recent book on Labour's return to power, Starmer has exerted tight control over Labour's position on Israel since 7 October, in contrast to issues where he has been happy to delegate. His behaviour, they write, has been driven by several motivations: horror at the Hamas attacks; a desire, at least in the early days, to show that Labour had moved on from the Corbyn years by signalling strong support for Israel; and a belief that any significant departure from the US position would be futile.\\nIn opposition, this involved saying as little as possible except that Israel had a right to defend itself and that international law should be respected. In government, Labour has criticised aspects of Israel's military campaign and has affirmed the UK's support for the international criminal court's jurisdiction. (It has said that the UK would fulfil its “legal obligations” if the Israeli prime minister, for whom the ICC has issued an arrest warrant, visits the UK – implying, but not directly confirming, that it would carry out an arrest.) On the occasions it has broken with US policy – for instance, when the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway recently placed individual sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers – it has tried to do so only in concert with other states.\\nThis is accompanied by a studied (some might say lawyerly) refusal to say in public whether or not the Israeli government as a whole is breaking international law. Doing so would have big implications, since Britain may then be obliged to follow its own human rights laws and impose wider-reaching sanctions, potentially suspending its substantial trade, military cooperation and intelligence-sharing agreements with Israel. Officials may have to reveal what they knew when; among other things, it is a criminal offence for public servants to knowingly assist in war crimes overseas.\\nIt has led to some erratic gestures. Most prominently, in March, Downing Street forced the foreign secretary, David Lammy, to walk back comments that by blocking aid from reaching Gaza – an act now causing mass starvation – Israel had definitely broken international law. (The official line was that Israel was only “at risk” of doing so.) In public, ministers have said, once again, that it is for the courts to determine whether Israel is committing genocide. But Starmer has also invoked his own legal credentials to deflect criticism. “I'm well aware of the definition of genocide,” he snapped in a testy exchange at prime minister's questions last November, “and that is why I've never described this as […] genocide”. (The international court of justice, which is considering an accusation of genocide made against Israel by South Africa, is not expected to deliver a ruling until 2027.)\\nThe most delicate footwork, however, relates to weapons sales. On taking office last year, Labour announced a review of UK arms exports to Israel. Britain is one of the world's largest arms producers, with export orders worth about £10bn a year, and in theory a system exists to stop them being used for human rights abuses. Manufacturers can only export weapons if the government gives them a licence to do so – although, according to a recent whistleblower, the system is too easy to manipulate.\\nAt the end of August 2024, according to documents recently disclosed to the high court, Starmer personally phoned Netanyahu to warn him that the UK would be suspending 30 of 350 arms export licences. Civil servants had assessed there was a risk Israel would use these weapons to violate international law, but there was an exception. Essential parts produced by British companies for F-35 planes – the world's deadliest fighter jets, designed and made mostly in the US – would continue to be shared among the UK's allies, including Israel, since they were necessary for “global peace and security”.\\nThis summer, a long-running legal challenge to that decision came to a head in the high court. Lawyers for the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq argued it contravened the genocide convention, the Geneva conventions, the UN arms trade treaty and the UK's own export licensing rules. In its defence, part of the evidence for which was presented in secret, the government argued that continuing to supply the parts – which contribute to a joint programme between the UK, the US and several other Nato members, as well as favoured partners such as Israel and Saudi Arabia – was necessary to maintain a deterrent against Russia. Moreover, said the government, it was impossible for the UK to determine where the parts are distributed, since the US arms company Lockheed Martin controls many of the warehouses in which they are stored. As with so many other things, it was ultimately the US calling the shots – or, as the government's lawyers put it in more opaque language, “the US is primarily responsible for contracting with contractors”.\\nOn 30 June, the high court ruled in the government's favour, saying that decisions about security were a matter for the executive, not the courts. For some people I spoke to, this is just the unpleasant reality of politics. “National security interests sometimes mean that you have to do things or tolerate things that you might not otherwise be very happy about,” Grieve told me. Others are less forgiving. Yasmine Ahmed of Human Rights Watch, which intervened in the case in support of Al-Haq, told me that the government's position that it can opt out of the rules risks undermining the effectiveness of key human rights treaties.\\nEven more alarming, Ahmed said, was the government's reasoning over why it was not bound to act by the genocide convention, which says states have a duty to prevent genocide if there is a serious risk of it occurring. Government lawyers argued that a state could only be said to have breached that duty if it could be definitively proven that an act of genocide had taken place – “a very difficult exercise, which could take many years”, said the government – in other words, only after the event, when it would be too late to stop it. “That's just a shocking position to take,” Ahmed told me. “It's morally repugnant but also legally and factually wrong.”\\nEven supportive observers are critical of the decision to keep supplying F-35 parts, seeing it as emblematic of a wider lack of action to defend human rights in Gaza. “What happened on 7 October [2023] was a terrible crime, but there is no justification for what is going on today in Gaza, none whatsoever,” Philippe Sands told me. “The fact that it wasn't stopped long ago and that the British government has not gone further makes me extremely unhappy. Even if Britain is a friend of Israel, the role of friends is to speak truth to power.”\\nSands's fellow human rights expert Conor Gearty sympathises with the pressures Labour are under, but is critical nonetheless. “Starmer, Hermer, Lammy – they're all lawyers. [Lammy is also a qualified barrister and practised law before entering politics.] They're committed to law, but they can't bear the full consequences of committing to law.” A former senior diplomat who worked in Washington DC during the past decade told me that while the pressure from Trump was real, blaming the US was also an excuse British politicians often used when they wanted to avoid owning their decisions. “It's quite convenient, saying, ‘Oh don't do that, the Americans won't like it,'” said the former diplomat.\\nThis approach has also upset many civil servants representing the UK overseas. Earlier this year, more than 300 Foreign Office staff sent an open letter to Lammy raising fears they had become complicit in war crimes committed by Israel; in response, the department's chief civil servant told them to consider resigning. “It's quite humiliating for a lot of people,” says a former civil servant who recently worked at the Foreign Office. “People working on Russia and Ukraine are saying, how can we be demanding accountability for human rights abuses here when we're ignoring them in Gaza? We look like hypocrites.”\\nThe former civil servant said that when Labour took power, they were “hopeful that Labour would realise the value of the rule of law and work to uphold it. This didn't last. If anything, Lammy's response to the letter was more ‘corporate computer says no' than David Cameron [his Conservative predecessor as foreign secretary]. Cameron would at least read the letter and think about a response rather than ‘HR' it.”\\nWe've been here before. New Labour took office in 1997 promising great things on human rights – incorporating the ECHR into law at home and promising an “ethical foreign policy” abroad. It did the legal, procedural part, introducing the Human Rights Act and lending British support to global initiatives such as the international criminal court. But it backed away from the wider project. As the Human Rights Act came into force, it was attacked by the rightwing press. Under pressure – as the human rights expert Francesca Klug writes in her 2015 book on the subject – the Blair government abandoned a public awareness campaign extolling the benefits of the act. It also dropped plans to extend its reach to the economic sphere, which would have made issues such as a decent standard of living a matter of human rights, too, as the Universal Declaration originally envisioned. Meanwhile, Blair's enthusiastic participation in the “war on terror” helped undermine the UN and led him to restrict civil liberties at home.\\nCarne Ross, a senior diplomat under the Blair government who resigned in protest at the Iraq war, told me that the travails of the Starmer government remind him of this period. “There's a sense that human rights is a luxury parties give themselves in opposition, but in government national security takes over,” said Ross. “It's a false choice, though, because prioritising human rights is a greater contribution to long-term stability and ultimately security.”\\nHuman rights advocates have plenty of specific policy demands. But is there more the UK could do to defend the system as a whole? For Gearty, Labour's contortions reflect “the weakness that is at the core of Britain's standing in the world, which voters can never be told about, because British voters continue to believe that this country is a world power”. The trouble, according to Gearty, is that these contortions only make the problem worse. “Britain has little credibility for three reasons,” he said. “One, it is seen as the child of America, with no independent engagement. Two, Britain is an imperial nation that has not yet addressed what imperialism meant; it still largely believes that it granted independence to grateful global south entities. And three, having left Europe, it has no strategic vision of anything.”\\nSands is slightly more optimistic. “We live in a world of double standards. So what's new? My entire life with international law, we've lived with these kinds of situations,” he says. Sands believes the threat to the postwar human rights system is real, because the world's three greatest powers – the US, Russia and China – are now all actively hostile to the project. “But in that context,” he says, “the Starmer government is going against the grain. I think it's courageous.” In particular, Sands adds, countries in the global south that do not want to be bullied by their larger neighbours are still strongly invested in the human rights system – and the UK has the power to support their struggle.\\nFor the barrister Jamie Burton, the dual meaning of equality – economic as well as political – is key. “It's a real mistake to think about human rights as just being about technical rules, the courts and litigation,” he says. “They're a description of what society is supposed to look like.” For Burton, a renewed focus on economic equality would help take the sting out of the right's claims that human rights are for “other” people only and disadvantage ordinary British citizens. At one point, at least, Starmer was known to be sympathetic to this argument. In opposition, according to Pogrund and Maguire, he would frequently brandish a copy of the Marmot review, a landmark decade-long study on health and inequality in Britain, as an example of where Labour's attention should lie. Now? It's less clear.\\nWhen writing this piece, one story I heard kept coming back to mind. Earlier this year, a delegation of British Palestinians met with Starmer to ask for more aid to reach Gaza and for refugees to be allowed to join their relatives in the UK. As one of the Palestinians there described it to me, Starmer listened patiently and sensitively to their concerns, but did not propose anything new. Towards the end of the meeting, a teenage member of the group spoke up. “She said, ‘My ambition in life is to be a human rights lawyer like you. And I was very disappointed to hear what you just said. We were expecting more.'”\\nThe Palestinian campaigner continued: “I thought, that's very brave of her,” he told me, adding that he was worried, at first, that she had offended their host. But he was surprised by the prime minister's reaction – or lack of it. “He looked a bit shocked, but he didn't say anything.” \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\"]"

         "[\"The Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility in May where immigrants rounded up as part of the Trump administration's campaign of mass deportation were being housed. She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical care.\\nTwo months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied entry.\\nIt wasn't an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held.\\nDemocratic officials' legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president's supercharged immigration agenda.\\n“The administration's goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they're doing in the dark to others who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.”\\nMcIver, who has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding.\\nRepublicans accuse Democrats of failing to follow protocol, and say their unannounced visits are more political grandstanding than genuine congressional oversight. But Democrats counter that it is their responsibility to shed light on the most hidden aspects of Trump's deportation agenda, which has ensnared Daca recipients, legal residents and even US citizens.\\nA report released last week by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff's office, compiled in part from site visits, found widespread human rights abuses in immigrant detention centers, including the mistreatment of pregnant women and children. “Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,” the report noted. The DHS sought to debunk the report, calling its allegations “garbage” and saying Ossoff and his staff have never been denied oversight visits.\\nLast month, a dozen Democratic members of Congress filed suit over a Trump-era DHS policy requiring members of Congress and their staff to provide a week's notice before any requested visit. They say the requirement is more than red tape – it is unconstitutional. The rule, the lawmakers argue in their suit, unlawfully restricts their oversight authority and prevents a co-equal branch of government from doing its job.\\nUnder a provision of federal law that funds Ice, the government may not prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens”. Requiring advance notice, Democrats say, gives the administration time to create a misleading picture of daily operations.\\n“This is kind of like general oversight 101,” Colorado representative Jason Crow, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs, told the Guardian. “You announce a visit, and they roll out what they want you to see, and things are dressed up and cleaned up.”\\nCrow has conducted site inspections at immigration detention sites in his district since 2019 – and he helped pass the law that solidified Congress's right to make unannounced inspections. In July, he was blocked from entering a center in Aurora.\\nSimilar confrontations are playing out nationwide. On Wednesday, a delegation of Democratic representatives from New York, including the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Adriano Espaillat, were turned away from a center in Brooklyn now housing detained immigrants under a new agreement with the Bureau of Prisons.\\n“This blatant lack of respect towards the legislative branch is a deterioration of checks and balances,” Espaillat said after the encounter. “All while they hide their atrocities from the public.”\\nIn a response posted on X, the DHS called the lawmakers' efforts “deeply unserious”. “These members did not follow proper protocol and schedule their visit. Instead they brought a gaggle of media to drive clicks and fundraising emails,” the department said.\\nIn a statement, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Ice had imposed the new visitation policy to protect the president's constitutional authority to carry out immigration enforcement and protect agency personnel from “a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement – including by member of Congress themselves”.\\n“A week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President's constitutional authority,” she said.\\nAs relatives and lawyers struggle to locate and contact people in Ice custody, advocates say congressional visits are essential to building a public record of conditions inside facilities that operate far from public view.\\n“We are not talking about a mistake here and there,” said Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS. “We're talking about a pattern of abuse that is happening in multiple communities, and bearing witness to that, and building that record so that members who may want to … are not able to say that this is happenstance or anecdotal.”\\nIce arrests and detentions rose sharply in the first six months after Trump returned to the White House. In Democratic-leaning states masked Ice agents are frequently arresting immigrants at worksites, in the streets and in mass roundups – aggressive tactics that triggered protests in cities such as Los Angeles. Their targets are increasingly people with no criminal records at all.\\nAs arrests soar to record numbers, the nation's immigration detention system – a patchwork of government-run and private facilities – is buckling under the strain. By late June, it was over capacity by more than 13,500 people, according to a Guardian analysis of public data from the Deportation Data Project. Ten immigration detainees have died in federal custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024.\\nMcLaughlin called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers “categorically false”. The agency, she added, has “worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space” to accommodate the Trump administration's mass arrest and incarceration operation.\\nThe scramble to create more detention beds has seen the agency sign new contracts with private prisons companies, as well as federal and state prisons. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, recently touted plans to open a detention center in Indiana it calls the “Speedway Slammer”, following the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz”, a facility built in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Last week, the Pentagon said Fort Bliss, an army base in Texas, was prepared to accept as many as 1,000 immigrant detainees by the end of the month.\\nOn Tuesday, the Trump administration was ordered to improve conditions inside an immigration holding facility in New York City, after advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of detainees who described being kept in unsanitary and overcrowded cells, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products.\\n***\\nShortly after immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, triggering days of tense protests, Congresswoman Judy Chu of California said her office began receiving urgent requests from advocates and worried family members asking for help locating people believed to be held at a center in the remote desert town of Adelanto.\\nChu had visited the facility several times during her years in office. But on 8 June, guards scrambled to lock the fence when she arrived with California congressmen Gil Cisneros and Derek Tran, she recounted. The trio shouted their names and held up signs identifying themselves as members of Congress – but they were turned away.\\n“It was illegal, of course, because we have this right to go in,” Chu said in an interview.\\nMore than a week later, Chu and a larger delegation of California Democrats were granted access to the facility and were able to meet with people detained during the raids, including a Daca recipient. Some said they had gone days without a change of clothes and were, in many cases, unable to call their families or legal representatives.\\n “We must keep on trying, because otherwise we don't know what will happen to these detainees,” Chu said, vowing to push for more access. “The less attention that is being given through our oversight inspections, the more [DHS] thinks it can get away with the worst conditions possible.”\\nCongressman Jay Obernolte, a Republican of California, came away with a different impression when he toured the Adelanto facility in July, days after Trump deployed the national guard and active duty marines to quell the immigration protests that had erupted across Los Angeles. In a statement, he said that those in custody at the facility have “access to medical care, legal counsel, meals, and the full rights guaranteed under federal law”.\\n“Facilities like Adelanto exist to help Ice enforce our immigration laws and keep our communities safe,” he said. “The vast majority of detainees housed here have committed serious crimes in addition to being present in our country illegally. They are being processed quickly, fairly, and humanely.”\\nIn a statement,\\u200b a spokesman\\u200b for the private prison firm GEO Group said that\\u200b the detention facilities it operates, like Adelanto in California and elsewhere across the country, provide “around-the-clock access to medical care\\u200b” as well as “in-person and virtual\\u200b legal and family visitation” in addition to other services. \\u200bThe detention centers adhered to strict federal detention standards on safety, food and medical care in addition to the facility's capacity, the spokesman said, stating: “Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.\\u200b”\\nAs Democratic officials continue to face barriers, they have started sharing best practices for securing access.\\nBefore visiting a facility in Eloy, Arizona, to check on a local restaurant owner held there in Ice custody, Congressman Greg Stanton consulted another member of Congress for advice. He brought a copy of the law that affirms members' oversight rights and asked to speak with senior officials on site.\\nStill, he was refused entry.\\n“I think others feel the same way I do, which is, you don't get to pick and choose which laws you follow,” Stanton said. “And it may be inconvenient to have a member of Congress show up and try to do their duty of oversight, but that doesn't matter. This is what the law says, and you've got to follow the law.”\\nBrian Todd, a spokesman for the private prison contractor CoreCivic, which operates the Eloy Detention Center, said that while the company endeavors to be “as accommodating and transparent as possible,” all congressional visits must be coordinated through Ice's office of congressional relations. He also said that the facilities were closely monitored by federal observers to ensure compliance and said claims of poor food or water quality at the center were “patently false”.\\n“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people,” Todd said, “but the fact is we operate safe, secure facilities that provide high quality services for our government partners at Ice”.\\nCrow, the Colorado congressman, began inspections of a privately operated immigration facility outside Denver in 2019, following repeated community reports about poor conditions, disease outbreaks, access to medical care and poor food storage.\\n“I represent a lot of immigrants and refugees, and frequently we're dealing with their families or with constituents and checking on individual conditions or access to counsel for residents of our district,” he said.\\nAt first, access was limited – prompting his push to strengthen protections for members of Congress. He eventually created a toolkit complete with a template for oversight visits, which he now shares with other members of Congress.\\n“There are egregious abuses occurring on a daily basis around the country, everything from unmarked vans with masked agents jumping out and grabbing people … to the lack of access to legal counsel and a variety of abuses,” he said. “So that's what we're worried about. And clearly this administration wants to hide their activities.”\\nMcIver, whose charges stem from an attempt to shield Newark mayor Ras Baraka from arrest during a protest at the facility, said she still has a right to conduct oversight visits – she remains a member of Congress and serves on a homeland security committee. But with a serious legal case pending, she has opted not to return – for now.\\n“They're using me as an example to try to be as cruel as possible to me and humiliate me and intimidate me, hoping that that will carry over to other people,” she said.\\nDespite the risks, other Democratic members of Congress are still showing up – even when doors are slammed in their faces – because, as McIver put it, “it's their job”.\\n“They're not stopping.”\", \"It starts with a quiz from a law firm: did your grandparents leave before or after 1951? Do you have their passports or marriage certificate?\\nIf I answer correctly, I will get another email from a lawyer who specializes in citizenship claims. If I do not, my file may be quietly marked as a long shot. The stakes are high: if successful, I could ultimately obtain an EU citizenship for myself and then perhaps for other members of my family.\\nLike many other Americans, I began this process in a moment of disillusionment. Since the 2024 election, I have been living with what I have come to call “citizenship insecurity”, a new category of instability that millions of us are now grappling with. It is the unsettling sense that a US passport, once a symbol of safety and mobility, is no longer something we identify with.\\nI am not living in fear of Ice raids; I am privileged enough to be a US citizen. I am not applying for another passport out of immediate danger or fear. Instead, it is about estrangement: I no longer recognize my country's values.\\nSince the US's inception, Americans have told ourselves a story about who we are and what we represent. We knew we were not perfect, but we thought America at least pretended to try to stand up for democracy and human rights. Much of that story has been tossed aside in the last decade, along with the dismantlement of our social contracts. “Citizenship insecurity” captures the depth of that unraveling, not necessarily imminent danger but no longer recognizing America, or trusting its values.\\n“My anxiety is through the roof right now, but I think it would be worse if I were not a citizen,” says Juan M Hincapie-Castillo, a researcher at the University of North Carolina and a recently naturalized American who first came to this country as an international student.\\nHe is experiencing citizenship insecurity to the max. “I am still brown, queer, and have an accent. I have tattoos that I cover every time I travel and go through TSA,” he says. “I keep hearing stories of legal residents and citizens being detained.”\\nThe instability Hincapie-Castillo experiences is a more targeted and virulent form than what I am experiencing. Right now, just being queer or brown – or even simply having tattoos, given the outsized role those have played in the recent roundups of alleged immigrant gang members – can seem to make a person more vulnerable to being singled out.\\nJust this month, Hincapie-Castillo's medical research on pain management treatments was defunded by the Trump administration. He studies trigeminal neuralgia, a facial nerve condition that is so cruel it is sometimes referred to as a “suicide disease”.\\nHis work had been funded for five years by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), but the grant was terminated after only one year. The stated reason for termination: a new NIH policy declaring that research programs connected to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are “antithetical to scientific inquiry”. (Some demographics' pain no longer counts to those in power, apparently.)\\nIndeed, this is another part of citizenship insecurity today: the economic pressures on scholars as federal funding has been haphazardly cut in the sciences and other disciplines. A number of these academics are internationally born, which adds an additional layer of uncertainty.\\n“The fear is always there,” he says of his current life. “I carry my US passport now everywhere I go, just in case.”\\nOf course, the woes of American citizens experiencing insecurity like Hincapie-Castillo do not even compare to the threat against non-citizens: it is as if many of us are nesting dolls of uncertainty.\\nBy 1 June, 51,302 people were in Ice detention. As of 13 July , the number had ticked up to 56,816. The Ice site has not shared numbers for deportations in 2025 publicly yet. The current head of Ice apparently told an Arizona Mirror reporter that our deportation system needs to be more like “Amazon Prime, but with human beings”. He meant that as a good thing.\\nAnd yet, the fear American citizens who are in far less outright peril also feel is still real. Recently, Donald Trump threatened to withdraw the actor Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship. Petulant as his threat was, it nonetheless showed that the president would like to denaturalize even native-born people who he reviles. The threat to birthright citizenship speaks to that same issue.\\n***\\nCitizenship insecurity is about grappling with what it means to be American when so many of our supposed ideals have vanished – not just from policy, but from political discourse itself.\\nThis is not the first time Americans have lived alongside wars or policies they did not support. For decades, many of us have witnessed enormous political endeavors we did not approve of, from the war in Iraq to the war in Vietnam. This included the “forever wars”, which were attacks on much we valued about our country, all at once, but it also included phenomena that presage and accompany those wars: torture, military occupation and Islamophobia at home.\\nAs a journalist focused on income inequality and economic insecurity, I did not buy into the “American dream” mythos. Editing big stories about economic inequality in this country day in, day out, I have been shown over and over that the notion of pulling yourself by your bootstraps is a fantasy. I have interviewed people who did everything “right” – saving money, pursuing higher education, working 40 hours a week – and still live from paycheck to paycheck, unable to buy a home or to even recognize a clear life trajectory.\\nNonetheless, a small part of myself held on to an idea of America as a beacon of sorts, as it had been for my immigrant grandparents.\\nMy grandfather left a town that has been controlled by different countries in eastern Europe for the US in 1929, returned to marry my grandmother, and together they came back again in the early 1930s. But most of our family did not make it out. They died there: Jews caught in a hideous historical fulcrum, crushed by the machinery of genocide and occupation.\\nAs a result, my grandparents loathed talking about the past and what happened there, preferring to pass it over in silence. What would they think of the choice that I and others were hoping to make now?\\nAmerica had offered them a chance to own their own store and for their children to go to college; my mother even made it to the Ivy League on scholarship. It was not a country I ever wanted to have an opportunity to leave or thought I or my family might need one.\\nThat has changed – for me and others.\\nNadia Kaneva, for example, is a media and communications professor at the University of Denver who has spent years studying how nations brand themselves. Born in Bulgaria and only recently naturalized as an American, Kaneva is feeling citizenship insecurity in real time.\\nAs a scholar, she has long understood how a country that is no longer desirable to emigrate to affects and is affected by foreign investment, tourism and brain drain. In the US, symbolic security has started to erode and other countries are jumping on the opportunities. A few European universities, for instance, have announced programs to recruit American researchers to Europe, especially if they are, say, public health scholars or environmental studies specialists or sociologists concentrating on gender.\\nKazim Ali, a co-founder of Nightboat Books and the author of the book Resident Alien, feels that the challenge to his and others' identities as Americans is “existential as well as direct”. He emigrated here with his parents, who were Muslims born in India (“So India doesn't feel like home, either, at the moment,” he says).\\nWould he ever consider leaving? To this, he quotes the Uruguayan poet Cristina Peri Rossi, who once said of her condition of exile and return: “I don't want to trade one nostalgia for another.”\\n***\\nIt is not only longtime citizens who are rethinking what it means to be American. Even those newly eligible for citizenship – people who once looked forward to formally pledging allegiance – are now pausing.\\nThose people “have told me they are now torn”, says Michele Wucker, a risk governance expert who also has written extensively about citizenship. “The actions of this administration do not align with the country they thought we were. And now they question the logic of becoming a citizen out of fear of how Maga believes we should treat non-citizens.”\\nOf course, some argue that seeking out the insurance of a second passport or planning to escape to a university job in another country is weak-hearted – that we must stay and fight for the democracy we want to live in. Others decry running away as unpatriotic, as when scholars of authoritarianism at Yale – Timothy Snyder, Jason Stanley and Marci Shore – announced publicly that they were moving to Canada for academic positions.\\nIn response, the scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan wrote that we should seek ballast from the writer James Baldwin's “unromantic patriotism” in these times and “stay, fight, and to urge others to as well.”\\nI see his and other writers' point: given my own relatively privileged position, I would never leave this country unless I really felt I had to.\\nI interviewed a Jewish faith leader who is originally from Israel, has an American passport but is also in the middle of obtaining her Portuguese citizenship (she is Sephardic, meaning her ancestors are from the Iberian peninsula). She wants to remain anonymous in part to protect her child, who is transgender, and expanding her options for citizenship feels more urgent than ever. She is also applying, she says, because the current American political situation plays “into centuries-old insecurity of the Jewish people”. For her, citizenship insecurity has been compounded by what she calls “the state of violence of the country [Israel] I come from”. The sense of instability is not confined to one place – it echoes across borders. It is not just about mobility or paperwork – it is about protection, about having somewhere for her child to go if things get worse.\\nMelissa Aronczyk, a media studies professor at Rutgers University and author of Branding the Nation: the Global Business of National Identity, comes from Canada. She has been thinking of returning home “incessantly” since January. “There is a cabal of Canadians in the US where that's a central topic right now,” she says. In conversations in a Facebook group for her fellow expats living in the US, trying to get their kids into Canadian universities has become a far more insistent theme as of late. “Canadian American parents getting their kids to apply to Canadian rather than American universities was once a tuition move,” says Aronczyk. Now, she says it's also political as well.\\nAronczyk, like many of the people I spoke to, is quick to acknowledge her relative privilege. We know we are lucky, even, in being able to consider second citizenships. But that is precisely the point: when even the relatively economically secure feel as if the ground shifts beneath them, it signals just how deep and wide this instability runs.\\nAs an expert on national branding, Aronczyk notes that the US's image has sharply deteriorated in the past six months. Since the start of Trump's second administration, global perceptions of America “have gone negative, by almost every measure”.\\nA national brand is defined as much by people with American passports as people watching our country from the outside: students, tourists and investors, she points out.\\n***\\nIn June, I started my regular correspondence with a law firm representing people seeking European citizenship. Each time I wrote and heard back from them, I recalled my beloved grandfather.\\nIn one old photo, he wore his cavalry uniform, adorned with sparking buttons. I remember that handsome expression from my childhood in the 1970s when he was already an old man, still attractive and bewildered. Whether that was due to his feeling caught in the gears of history or not it was hard to say.\\nWhat I do know was he was eager to be the sort of American who took his kids to movie palaces and had college money tucked away for their grandchildren, no matter that he and grandma worked six days a week in a shoe store to be able to do so. In his old age, he got to watch Star Trek with his feet up as the two ate strawberry ice-cream. Occasionally, once retired, my grandmother would even attend outdoor classical concerts and free Shakespeare plays with her friends. This, to them, was the American dream.\\nIt still strikes me as uncanny, to even be considering giving myself and my family the possibility to go elsewhere if the worst happens here. After all, this country was my grandparents' refuge. But I imagine they would understand, and even approve. They knew all too well the cost of having the wrong citizenship at the wrong time.\", \"A day after Donald Trump announced that he was firing Lisa Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, the White House proudly released a photo. It showed Trump, his cabinet and other officials giving a thumbs-up. Of the 24 people in the Oval Office, only one was Black.\\nFor those who have studied the US president's long and troubling history of racism, the two events were more than mere coincidence. They were indicative of a man who has recently brought white nationalist perspectives from the margins back to the mainstream.\\nTrump has vehemently denied that he is a racist, pointing to a modest increase in support among African American voters in last year's election, when his opponent was a Black woman. But critics suggest that his effort to oust Cook fits a pattern of purging diverse voices from the higher ranks of leadership.\\n“He chose to fire her out of all the governors because she's a Black woman,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of the organisation Black Voters Matter. “His goal is to get control of the Federal Reserve and for that to no longer be an autonomous, independent body. But what he does recognise is that in America everything is about race. It is as lethal as a nuclear bomb.”\\nCook taught economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and was previously on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. She was a Marshall scholar who received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, a historically Black women's college in Atlanta.\\nCook dedicated much of her scholarship to examining how racial discrimination and targeted violence created barriers to economic advancement for African Americans. She also advised the Nigerian and Rwandan governments on banking reforms and economic development.\\nIn 2022 she was confirmed to the Fed's board of governors by the Senate in a party-line vote. Republicans argued that she was unqualified and found her research overly focused on race; Democrats brushed off such critiques as unfounded.\\nOn Monday, Trump said he fired Cook after the director of a housing regulatory agency, whom the president appointed, alleged that she committed mortgage fraud. She refused to resign and filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump has no power to remove her from office.\\nTrump's order aligned with his effort to expand his power across once independent parts of the federal government and broader economy and culture. It also marked another potential high-profile removal of a Black leader from the federal government amid Trump's broader crusade against diversity and inclusion policies.\\nBrown observed: “He knows that racism and sexism is a very effective tool to cast doubt and that's the pathway. Lisa Cook isn't even the chair of the board. So why would you pick her?\\n“He picked her because he is betting that, in an industry that is probably 90% or more white male, his odds of removing her are greater than the odds for removing others from the board. That in itself is rooted in the history and how insidious racism is built into the fabric of how we see people of colour in this country.”\\nOver the past seven months Trump has targeted other prominent Black leaders. He fired Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, the second Black man to serve in the position. Brown had delivered speeches about racial discrimination and issued policies that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the military.\\nThe president dismissed Carla Hayden, the first Black person to serve as librarian of Congress, after a conservative advocacy organisation accused her of being a “radical”. He ousted Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman to sit on the National Labor Relations Board, which hears private-sector labour disputes.\\nTrump's critics argue that his life and career have given succour to white supremacists. In 1973 he and his father were sued for housing discrimination in New York; in 1989 he took out full-page ads in several newspapers calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, Black and Latino youths who were later exonerated.\\nTrump broke through in national politics with the “birther” conspiracy theory, falsely claiming that Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore ineligible to be president. After a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there were “very fine people on both sides”.\\nHe has reportedly described Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries”, has called Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and “kung flu”, and, on the campaign trail last year, said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler.\\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has imposed a travel ban on many of the world's poorest countries even as the US granted refugee status to about 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial persecution and “white genocide”.\\nHe issued executive orders to curb DEI initiatives in the federal government and even sought to blame DEI for an air crash. He is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” from Smithsonian Institution museums, suggesting that there is too much focus on “how bad Slavery was”.\\nThe attempt to fire Cook is the most dubious move yet, prompting an outcry from Democrats and civil rights groups, who pointed to her gender and race as vital factors.\\nCongresswoman Nanette Barragán of California posted on the X social media platform: “If you haven't noticed yet – this is a disturbing pattern for Trump. Fire or drive out smart, competent women, in particular women of color, from high ranking positions and fill many of these positions with white men.”\\nDerrick Johnson, president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said: “Dr Cook's credentials outshine Trump's entire cabinet. This president simply cannot stomach Black excellence when it reveals his failures, particularly those in positions of power. In reality, this is about bending the Federal Reserve to Trump's will, and he's using racism as a tool to do it.”\\nBut Trump's actions are being cheered on by white nationalists. Far-right groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have been quoted as saying that they no longer need to take to the streets to demonstrate because the president has so comprehensively adopted their talking points and embraced their agenda.\\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, observed: “When you have white supremacists who are holding key roles in government and you have leaders in this country who come and play footsie to their drumbeat they don't have to resist because what they want is laid out for them in the form of a buffet.”\\nTrump has been quick to point to Black allies when politically expedient, such as Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, the representative Byron Donalds of Florida and Alveda King, a niece of the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. But critics note there is no guarantee this will translate to policies that address racial injustice.\\nNor has it manifested in significant representation at the heart of government. Towards the end of the first Trump presidency, the Washington Post identified 59 people who had held cabinet positions or served in top White House jobs. Only seven were people of colour and only one – the housing secretary, Ben Carson – was Black.\\nIn his second term, Trump has picked only one Black person to serve in his cabinet: Scott Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development. Joe Biden, by contrast, appointed the most diverse cabinet in history with more women and people of colour than any that had come before.\\nSeawright said: “We went from generational progress to generational rollback, and what this president and this administration has done in seven months could take 70 years at least to replenish. It should be a friendly reminder for all people, but particularly African Americans, that all progress is not permanent.”\\nTrump's cabinet includes Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host with no experience of running a major organisation, at the Pentagon; Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, at the health department; and Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling executive, at the education department. The White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has associated with white nationalist thinkers and groups and is the architect of his hardline immigration policy.\\nRashad Robinson, a civil rights leader and former president of the group Color of Change, added: “We live in a very diverse country, a country with many different types of people that come from many different backgrounds, and the president exhibits his values by who he puts in office.\\n“This is not simply that Donald Trump has put only one Black person in his cabinet. It's that Donald Trump has gone out of his way to find some of the most unqualified and ill-equipped people to put in those jobs as a way to actually avoid having to put Black people in his cabinet.”\\nFor Brown, the voting rights activist, Trump's cabinet picks demonstrate that he is “as racist as hell”. She added: “Quite frankly, I'm glad he doesn't have a whole lot of Black people in his cabinet because that would be deeply embarrassing to me. Who would work in that mess?”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"Brazil's supreme court has made Jair Bolsonaro the first former president in the country's history to be convicted for attempting a coup.\\nThe 70-year-old far-right leader claims he is the victim of political persecution, but four out of five judges concluded on Thursday that it was sufficiently proven that Bolsonaro and his close allies attempted to overturn the 2022 election, which he lost to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nSeven other members of his administration were also convicted, including senior military officers – something also unprecedented in a country that endured a brutal two-decade military dictatorship (1964–85).\\nAfter months of investigation, the federal police and the attorney general concluded that a “criminal organisation” led by Bolsonaro carried out a long list of different ways to keep the former paratrooper in power at all costs.\\nThe plot included a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-president and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who in 2022 was presiding over the electoral court. After the election, Lula and Moraes were closely monitored by special forces soldiers.\\nAccording to investigators, the murderous plot was abandoned only because Bolsonaro managed to win over just one of the three armed forces chiefs, the navy commander, while the heads of the air force and the army refused to join.\\nThe climax of the power-grab attempt was the riot on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula took office, when hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the presidential palace, congress and supreme court in the capital, Brasília.\\nThe only judge to acquit Bolsonaro was Luiz Fux, who argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the former president's guilt. He also contended that the trial should be annulled, saying the supreme court was not the proper venue and endorsing a defence claim that, because the investigation generated about 70 terabytes of documents, Bolsonaro's lawyers had been unable to review all the case materials.\\nBolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years and three months.\\nBolsonaro has been under house arrest since 4 August, accused of trying to intimidate the supreme court's judges through a campaign led by his son Eduardo Bolsonaro in the US that resulted in tariffs and sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.\\nThe former president still has the right to appeal, although the margin of his conviction makes it unlikely it will be overturned. Once the appeals are concluded, probably in October or November, the justices will decide where he will serve his sentence.\\nGiven his recurring health problems, linked to a stabbing during the 2018 campaign, Bolsonaro will probably remain under house arrest, in a hospital or in a special unit inside a barracks or police facility.\\nEven before this week's conviction, Bolsonaro was already barred from forthcoming elections due to two previous rulings by the electoral court, one for attacking the voting system and another for using the presidency for electoral purposes.\\nBrazil's largely conservative congress, however, may vote on an amnesty bill for him and hundreds of those convicted over the 8 January riot. Justices have already deemed the proposal unconstitutional, so if it passes, a judicial battle is expected.\\nMeanwhile, figures on the far right – including Bolsonaro's politician sons and his wife – are battling to decide who will be the candidate to take on the leftist president Lula, who has announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections.\\nTrump had previously criticised the case against Bolsonaro and used it as one of the justifications for his 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, but most Brazilian legal experts agree there was substantial evidence for conviction and that due process was observed.\\nAfter Thursday's verdict, the US president told reporters he was “very unhappy” with the conviction and that he'd always found Bolsonaro to be “outstanding”. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on X that Washington would “respond accordingly to this witch hunt”.\\nBrazil's foreign ministry called Rubio's comment a threat that “attacks Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence in the records”. The ministry said Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.\\nTrump had already revoked the visas of Moraes and other justices of Brazil's supreme court. Moraes was also targeted with Magnitsky sanctions, generally reserved for perpetrators of severe human rights violations.\", \"Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro and seven of his allies, including four senior members of the military, have gone on trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup – the first time in Brazilian history such powerful figures have faced justice for seeking to topple the country's democracy.\\nBolsonaro, a paratrooper turned far-right populist who governed from 2019 until 2023, stands accused of masterminding a failed power grab after losing the 2022 election to the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nBolsonaro and his seven alleged co-conspirators, including three army generals and the former head of the navy, face decades in jail if found guilty of being the driving force behind the unsuccessful plot.\\nOn Tuesday morning, the supreme court began what is expected to be a two-week judgment of the group. Over the course of eight televised hearings held between 2 and 12 September, five supreme court judges will decide their fate.\\nThe judge presiding over the trial, Alexandre de Moraes, kicked off the hearing describing how an anti-democratic plot to impose “a veritable dictatorship” had been foiled thanks to the strength of Brazilian society and institutions. A failure to punish that crime “would mean encouraging new attempted coups d'etat,” Moraes told the court, adding: “History teaches us that impunity, omission and cowardice do not lead to pacification.”\\nThe prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, told the court it was essential those behind the “frightening and shadowy” conspiracy be held to account.\\nBrazil has suffered more than a dozen attempted putsches and coups d'état since 1889, when it became a republic after its last emperor, Pedro II, was overthrown. The last successful power grab came in 1964, when US-backed generals deposed the then president, João Goulart, supposedly to thwart a communist threat and ushering in 21 years of brutal military rule.\\nBut the historian Danilo Araújo Marques said that never before had top military leaders or a former president been tried for attacking democracy. “This truly is unprecedented and historic,” said Marques, who is part of a research unit at the Federal University of Minas Gerais called Projeto República.\\n“Whenever there was an attempted coup, and the coup didn't succeed, there was always an amnesty – and now we're seeing precisely the opposite,” Marques added, hailing the trial as tribute to the maturity of Brazil's institutions and democracy, which was restored in 1985. “Our democracy is going through an acid test and it's possible it will come out of this strengthened.” \\nOn the eve of the trial, the US president, Donald Trump, has attempted to sabotage proceedings with what analysts called an unprecedented pressure campaign that has thrown US-Brazil relations into disarray.\\nClaiming Bolsonaro was the victim of a “witch-hunt”, Trump slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioned Alexandre de Moraes, the judge presiding over the case. Other supreme court justices and Lula officials have been stripped of their US visas. Bolsonaro's congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, has moved to the US to lobby Trump officials to take up his father's fight.\\n“It's a political intervention with an economic cudgel,” Thomas Shannon, a former US ambassador to Brazil, said of Trump's tariffs campaign.\\nShannon believed Trump had a clear political objective: to scupper Bolsonaro's prosecution, resuscitate the Brazilian populist's flagging political career, and allow Bolsonaro – who is currently banned from seeking office – to challenge Lula in next year's presidential election.\\nBut the ex-ambassador, who was based in Brasília from 2010 to 2013, believed the US president was mistaken if he believed he could help Bolsonaro escape punishment and “storm back into power” – just as Trump did last year.\\n“It [shows] such a cartoon-like understanding of Brazil – and I think what the president is doing at the behest of the Bolsonaros is actually going to harm the Bolsonaros in a really significant way,” Shannon said, noting how polls showed support for the ex-president falling.\\nIn contrast, support for Lula appears to be increasing, with Brazil's president using Trump's offensive to position himself as a flag-waving patriot defending Brazilian interests from a foreign onslaught. Lula has started wearing a blue, Maga-style cap emblazoned with the words: “Brazil belongs to the Brazilians.”\\nAsked last week if he would be tuning into his rival's coup trial, Lula shrugged: “I've got better things to do.”\\nThose in the dock alongside Bolsonaro include some of the best-known figures in his administration: the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; the former security minister, Anderson Torres; the former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; and Bolsonaro's former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid.\\nThe accusations against them relate to an alleged conspiracy to launch a pro-Bolsonaro coup in the months between the October 2022 election and the far-right uprising in Brasília on 8 January 2023 – a week after Lula took power.\\nBolsonaro denies plotting a coup but has admitted seeking “alternative” ways to stop Lula taking office. All of the other defendants also maintain their innocence, apart from Cid. He has collaborated with investigators as part of a plea deal and hopes to receive a reduced sentence.\\nIn an editorial marking the start of the trial, the O Globo newspaper said 2 September would go down in history as the day Brazil finally broke its “humiliating tradition” of failing to prosecute coup-mongering presidents and generals.\\n\\u200bThe judgment was celebrated as a “huge civilizatory leap forward” by the conservative O Estado de São Paulo\\u200b:\\n“Perhaps this is why Trump is using the enormous power of the US to attack the supreme court and save Bolsonaro from his penal fate. Not out of friendship [for the Bolsonaros], but to stop an example of democratic resistance flourishing in Latin America's biggest nation, that reinforces the contrast with the genuflection of American institutions to Trumpism.”\\nBolsonaro has been under house arrest since early August after the supreme court ruled he had violated a court order banning him from social networks. Police have been stationed outside his mansion amid fears he could flee to the nearby US embassy. Earlier this month police claimed they had found a document on a phone seized from the ex-president indicating he had planned to abscond to Argentina and seek asylum from its rightwing president, Javier Milei.\\nOn Sunday – Brazil's independence day – Bolsonaro's supporters are expected to stage a show of force, rallying in major cities to demand he be absolved. Security has been stepped up around the supreme court, presidential palace and congress to avoid a repeat of the 8 January uprising, when all three buildings were ransacked by Bolsonaro supporters.\\nMarques predicted there were likely to be lively days ahead as Brazil's 40-year-old democracy notched up another landmark moment. “This is an important cycle that is closing,” he said of the decade-long rise and fall of Bolsonaro, a once obscure politician who shot to prominence during the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff, was elected in 2018, and now faces political annihilation.\\n“But the future is full of surprises,” Marques added. Even if Bolsonaro was convicted and jailed, “new chapters” could still be written, such as congress approving an amnesty, or a future rightwing president granting Bolsonaro a pardon. “Let's see what the future has in store for us.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.\\nFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro's closest allies – his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid – for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.\\nThere were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.\\nBolsonaro's former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.\\n“Today, Brazil is making history,” Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula's Workers' party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. “Brazil is saying: ‘Coups are a crime!'”\\nFabiano Leitão, a trumpeter who has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up\\u200b to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin's Funeral March that symbolised the former president's downfall. \\u200b“It's the end! It's the end of this guy!” Leitão\\u200b said as he pulled out his trumpet.\\nAfter playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician\\u200b \\u200blaunched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country's democracy, environment and minorities. “The extreme right is a mechanism\\u200b of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,” Leitão said. “Justice is done, comrades!”\\nBolsonaro's senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was “very surprising”.\\n“That's very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn't get away with it at all,” said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil's supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro's trial with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions.\\n“The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt\\u200b,” tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction “unjust”.\\nEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father's conviction.\\nIn a post on social media, Brazil's foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying “threats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio … will not intimidate our democracy”.\\nThe former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Brasília's foreign embassies.\\nProgressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux's questioning of the judges' authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial's annulment in the future.\\n“I wouldn't declare Jair Bolsonaro's political death,” said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.\\nRocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year's elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro's foes; petitioning Donald Trump to heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro's plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.\\n“I think they'll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,” she predicted.\\nIn recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Brasília. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.\\nBut Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an “incentive to illegality”. “It would send an awful signal – it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,” he warned.\\n• This article was amended on 12 September 2025 to reflect that at the time of first publication three out of five judges had convicted Jair Bolsonaro, but that was later updated to four.\"]"

         "[\"Angela* was cuddling her daughter in bed one afternoon when the then two-year-old said something she had never heard before.\\n“Kiss my bum?” she asked, lifting her bottom up.\\n“Don't be silly, I am not going to kiss your bum,” Angela said gently, kissing her own hand to transfer a kiss to the side of her daughter's bottom cheek.\\nShe then asked why her daughter had asked this.\\nHer daughter told her a male educator at the childcare centre she attended had kissed her private parts while changing her nappy.\\nThe next day, Angela says, her daughter disclosed further allegations of sexual abuse and again named the educator. A medical assessment added weight to Angela's worst fear: that she had been the subject of repeated sexual abuse at the centre.\\nAngela acted swiftly. She spoke to police, a GP, a mental health social worker, the childcare centre, and private and public sector investigators. She was confident her daughter's disclosure – supported by clinical notes showing the child had named the worker in the presence of a doctor before being urgently referred to a specialist – would be sufficient to have the educator removed from the system.\\nBut what followed has exposed the shocking shortcomings in Australia's childcare system that see hundreds of complaints about sexual misconduct by childcare workers ultimately dismissed, and regulators unwilling or unable to take action against alleged perpetrators if police decline to prosecute a criminal case.\\nAfter three separate investigations – a preliminary police investigation that stalled because Angela's daughter was not comfortable giving an official statement to officers, as well as one by a workplace relations company and the other by the Victorian education department – the conclusion was reached that there was insufficient evidence to remove the educator from his role. \\nThe complaint was, according to Victoria's reportable conduct scheme, “unsubstantiated – insufficient evidence”.\\nWhile the term appears to diminish the claim, technically the finding meant “there was significant strong evidence that supports the allegation, but the evidence falls short of being able to make a substantiated finding”.\\nWithout corroborating images, footage or another witness, the disclosure of a two-year-old to her mother – supported by a letter from mental health professional describing her symptoms as “consistent with sexual assault victims” – was not enough.\\nThis leaves the worker still employed, hundreds more children potentially at risk from a suspected paedophile and the family deeply troubled by the lack of action.\\nAngela's experience is an almost textbook example of one of the major failings afflicting the childcare system: an opaque, inconsistent, underfunded and often ineffective regulatory system.\\nThe federal government has rushed to act on children's safety in childcare services after the harrowing allegations of sexual abuse by a childcare worker in Melbourne, using the first week of the new term of parliament to introduce legislation that would allow it to strip funding from failing childcare services and conduct spot checks of centres.\\nBut experts have told Guardian Australia the problems run far deeper, and that the government risks introducing what amount to “reactive strategies” that won't address the real problems.\\nThey say that when complaints and allegations are made, they are assessed by state regulatory bodies beset with “irregularities and inconsistencies” when it comes to how they investigate and how they report allegations. These bodies appear to be hamstrung in taking action against individual workers if the police decide there is not enough evidence to criminally prosecute.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nWhen one mother in the Northern Territory arrived at her child's daycare centre to pick them up at the end of the day, she saw her three-year-old – through gaps in a fence – in an outdoor area.\\nThe child was standing between the legs of a seated male educator she had never seen before, who was rubbing the child's backside with his hands, according to a statement she would give to NT police, a redacted version of which has been seen by Guardian Australia.\\nThe mother immediately reported the incident to the centre and to police. NT police investigated but, according to their record of investigation, released under freedom of information laws, because there were no other witnesses and no CCTV footage, police concluded there was “not enough evidence” to prosecute and so declined to pursue charges.\\nThe early childhood education and care regulator for the territory – the Quality Education and Care Northern Territory (QECNT) – also launched an investigation.\\nBut ultimately QECNT concluded: “As police are not pursuing [the] matter, that QECNT could not take any further action, as there had been nothing to indicate the service should have taken a different course of action.”\\nBecause the centre had not breached any rules in relation to the allegation or its handling of it, and police weren't prosecuting the individual, there was no action the QECNT could take against him.\\nThe educator was a casual worker who had been placed in the centre by a temp agency.\\nIn the QECNT's log of the steps it took as part of its investigation, it noted that after the accused casual educator heard that police were closing the investigation, he had “phoned to state he has been cleared and requested to come back to work”.\\nThe log contains a summary of a conversation between the educator and someone, whose name is redacted but appears to be an employee of the temp agency, saying: “There have been some services that have requested he don't come back and she can't place him in those services … She indicated he may want to seek employment directly from a service” and that she would “keep him on the ‘books'.”\\nThe case highlights an problem that experts say is of concern when it comes to regulating childcare services: there is little that can be done about educators who are accused of serious incidents, including sexual abuse, but whom police do not prosecute.\\nWhile an individual daycare centre might then request that a casual worker not come back for any shifts, or bar them from working there, there is nothing to stop the educator from finding employment at another centre, nor any record that the individual has been suspended from or asked not to return to a previous place of employment.\\nThis is not a new problem. For years key players in the sector have flagged that childcare services have no way to act on, or keep records of, “unsubstantiated” complaints.\\nIn late 2023 the Australian Children's Education and Care Quality Authority (Acecqa) conducted a review into the regulatory system. It found that such cases often came down to “a child's word against an educator['s]”.\\n“This often leads to unsubstantiated claims, where no further action is taken,” Acecqa said in its report to state and territory ministers.\\nIt said these individual workers, who could be deemed as “persons of interest”, provide a “unique challenge” from a regulatory monitoring point of view, because the sector doesn't have a clear system for tracking them.\\n“[Childcare services] have no way to share this information with another Approved Provider considering employing that person unless they are contacted as a referee,” it said.\\nThe federal education minister, Jason Clare, ordered the review after charges were laid against Ashley Paul Griffith, now known as Australia's worst paedophile. Griffith was found guilty last year of abusing 73 girls while working in childcare in Brisbane and Italy over two decades.\\nGriffith had also been the subject of previous allegations – one more than a decade before his arrest.\\nOne Brisbane mother claimed that in 2009 she went to police to report allegations that Griffith had sexually abused her son but they had not investigated.\\nShe told the Nine Network's A Current Affair that her four-year-old son had told her “Ashley hurt me” and went into graphic detail about the alleged sexual abuse.\\nShe took her son to a police station but claims officers only spoke to the boy for a few minutes, did not attempt to build rapport with him and, when he didn't disclose the abuse to them during the brief interview, says she was “advised that there was nothing to warrant further investigation, and it was over”.\\n“We left the police station feeling bewildered, disbelieved and possibly crazy.”\\nShe told A Current Affair: “We tried so many years ago to make it known that Ashley Griffith is a dangerous paedophile – no one listened, no one cared.”\\nA report into Griffith by the Queensland Child Death Review Board released this month found that concerns about reputation or legal risks may deter individuals from raising concerns within the childcare sector.\\nThe inquiry also found that more than one complaint was made about Griffith to his employers, the Early Childhood Regulatory Authority and the Queensland police, before his arrest.\\n“Of these complaints, the available information suggests they were not always progressed, and information was not shared between agencies,” the inquiry's interim report said. “Prior complaints made to QPS did not proceed to prosecution.”\\nThis meant that until Griffith's arrest, there was nothing to stop him maintaining his Blue Card – Queensland's working with children check.\\nIn its report to ministers, Acecqa recommended the government establish a centralised mechanism for sharing intelligence and keeping records so they could “monitor and respond to suspected misconduct and allegations about a ‘person of interest' who has unsubstantiated allegations”.\\nBut these warnings – and the same recommendations – have been sounded before.\\nAlmost a decade ago the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse noted that the inability to share information can enable perpetrators “to move between institutions and jurisdictions and pose ongoing risks to children”.\\nIt too made recommendations to ensure better information sharing, and for a consistent national approach for sectors including childcare, backed by legislation, to ensure children were protected.\\nSimilarly, the 2021 Tasmanian commission of inquiry highlighted concerns that individuals feared breaching privacy laws when sharing information about alleged abusers, while noting the need to collate information regarding all allegations and incidents of sexual misconduct – even if unsubstantiated.\\nAnne Hollonds, the national children's commissioner, says the federal government's proposal for a national register of childcare workers was an opportunity to address this enormous gap. But she argues that in developing the register, the government should consider whether it contains records of all serious allegations, substantiated or not.\\nShe acknowledges there are serious privacy and legal issues that need to be resolved before including unsubstantiated allegations on a national register, but also says it's an important way to identify a pattern of concerning behaviour.\\n“I think intuitively what I would say is that there should be a record … of reportable matters, whether substantiated or not.\\n“And I say that because it's when you look back on cases like the Ashley Griffith one that you see, maybe three reportable matters that were unable to be substantiated, maybe that's a sign of something, a pattern of behaviour, potentially.\\n“So then the question is: proactively, should we set the bar at a level that allows us to pick up a pattern in real time, even if not substantiated? … I'm asking that question. I don't know the answer. I think that needs to be considered.\\n“Given the difficulty of substantiation with non-verbal or barely verbal children, then what other measures should we have in place that are able to pick up a pattern of behaviour that might, in its quantum, be a sufficient cause for concern?”\\nHollonds says that assessment of who is suitable to care for children “shouldn't just rely on the working with children's check”.\\n“If we are prioritising the best interests of children … then we have to really address any barriers … for providers to be able to employ people who have a clean record, or to exclude those who don't,” which she says goes beyond people with criminal convictions.\\nOne mother who is all too familiar with the fact that a police conviction is not always possible is Jennifer*.\\nWhen she went to police to report that her then two-year-old daughter, Ava*, had disclosed she was sexually abused while at daycare, police repeatedly warned her that getting a conviction, or even laying charges against the alleged offender, was highly unlikely.\\nThe alleged offending occurred at a family daycare – a service run by an individual in their home, but which still receives the federal childcare subsidy – and the alleged offender was the partner of the woman running the service. Jennifer says she had no idea a man was living at the house where the children were cared for until Ava started talking about him.\\nEventually, Ava disclosed that the man had exposed himself to her and touched her private parts, Jennifer says. New South Wales police took statements from Ava and her parents and investigated.\\nThe Department of Education and the Department of Communities and Justice also investigated the allegations – but no charges were laid.\\nIn a summary of its findings, the education department wrote: “There was insufficient evidence to substantiate a breach of the National Law and Regulations. Insufficient evidence to determine [the alleged offender] posed a risk to children. No further action was taken by the department. The case was closed.”\\nNo action was taken against the man or the service, which is still operating, though Guardian Australia has not been able to confirm whether the man is still living at the premises.\\nJennifer would like to see reform to the way investigations into those working with children – or in close proximity to them – are undertaken, saying that the education department should be able to take some action against people who have had credible allegations made against them, even if the level of proof does not reach that required for a criminal conviction.\\n“That's a hard one because, you know, you don't want innocent people to be punished,” she says.\\n“[But] the level of evidence required for a conviction in court is so high; for beyond reasonable doubt. And when you've got no physical evidence and you've got the words of the two-year-olds, it's not going to stand up in court.”\\nWhen a report of a serious incident such as physical or sexual abuse is made against a childcare worker, multiple agencies swing – or should swing – into action.\\nIf criminal activity is alleged, police might investigate. The relevant state or territory regulator, often housed within the state's education department, will also receive a report.\\nBut data obtained by Guardian Australia through freedom of information laws show that responses and record-keeping vary wildly across the country.\\nSome jurisdictions, such as the NT, recorded just one or two reports of sexual abuse of a child in a childcare setting a year. Others, such as NSW, didn't separate out allegations of physical assaults and sexual abuse and so came back with hundreds.\\nThe responses also revealed that in the some states, in the vast majority of cases where allegations of physical and sexual assault of a child are reported and investigated, no action is taken by the regulator.\\nIn one state – South Australia – nearly 60% of the 147 reports of physical and sexual abuse of a child by a childcare worker from January 2020 until 31 October 2024 were not investigated by the regulator. It did not issue a single compliance notice (the strongest penalty which can include suspending a centre's right to operate or prohibiting a educator from working) for sexual or physical abuse of children in the nearly five years.\\nNSW had the highest number of reports of physical and sexual abuse of children in childcare centres to the state regulator, by a large margin, with, 1,856 incidents reported from 2020 until 31 October 2024.\\nInvestigations were launched into all of the incidents of alleged physical and sexual abuse reported to it. In 1,312 cases (70%), the investigation was completed and “no further action” was taken.\\nIn 13% of cases (244) administrative compliance action was taken, and in 180 cases (9.5%) statutory compliance action was taken. Other incidents were under investigation or handled in another case.\\nA spokesperson for the NSW Early Childhood Education and Care Regulatory Authority said: “We work closely with law enforcement and other agencies where required to support investigations. If a police investigation does not result in charges, we still conduct our own investigation and take strong action in line with the provisions of the National Law and Regulations.”\\nThe authority can bring prosecutions, and since 2021, it has prosecuted 34 providers, nominated supervisors and individuals, resulting in fines and conditional release, though none of these were in relation to sexual abuse allegations.\\n“I think one of the problems is we have a national quality framework and we're meant to have a nationally consistent approach … But because individual jurisdictions handle the monitoring and assessment of services, there are irregularities and inconsistencies across the country,” says Prof Marianne Fenech, an early childhood expert from the University of Sydney.\\nFenech says investment in quality education, including improving staffing levels and pay, and reducing the number of casual workers, was the hard work that needed to be done to improve the childcare industry, rather than the “reactive strategies” of CCTV and a national register that the government has suggested.\\n“If we just focus on reactive strategies to safety, we're missing the point and we're not going to deal with the bigger issues that are causing the safety problems in the first instance,” she says.\\nHollonds says in the last few weeks, as discussions have raged about safety in childcares and the government has introduced its new legislation, difficult conversations about reforming a huge, complicated industry are being had.\\nBut in many ways, this is all happening far too late, she says.\\n“Everyone is looking for answers. [But] it is a concern to me that we didn't work on these much earlier.\\n“These questions that you're asking me now, they are fundamental questions that go to the strength of the child safeguarding scaffolding underpinning the industry. And really, this should have been worked on many, many years ago … if not before then certainly the Ashley Griffith episode should have been the trigger for very proactive work on the regulatory system, making sure the regulators had the powers and the resources to do their job well, as well as all of these other elements that are being looked at now.\\n“I really don't understand why we've had to wait so long … before we acted.”\\n*Names have been changed\\n• In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800; adult survivors can seek help at Blue Knot Foundation on 1300 657 380.

In 1979, she woke up in bed to find the serial killer Fred West on top of her. It was by no means the first time West had assaulted the 17-year-old, but it was the last. This time, she managed to escape from the room she was renting at 25 Cromwell Street, perhaps Britain's most notorious address, where Fred and Rose West raped, tortured and murdered so many girls and young women. Fred West took his own life in January 1995 while on remand, charged with 12 murders. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders later that year and is serving a whole-life sentence.\\nIn her own way, Richards has also been serving a life sentence. Today, she is a youthful, likable and traumatised 65-year-old. How could she not be damaged by all she experienced? Although she gave vital evidence at Rose West's trial that helped get her convicted, she never told the police what Fred had subjected her to. Nor did she tell her nearest and dearest. She couldn't. She didn't know how to. Now, almost half a century later, she has written a memoir, Under Their Roof, that does so much more than chronicle her time living with the Wests. It's a desperately sad insight into what makes someone vulnerable to abusers, and why victims are often abused multiple times by different people. But ultimately, this is a book about the triumph – however painful and even fluky – of good over evil.\\nWe meet at the London office of her publisher. She is with her daughter Hannah, here for support. Richards speaks with a broad Irish accent despite having spent most of her life in England. She is immaculate in an understated way – smart long shaggy bob, pristine white\\xa0shirt. Not surprisingly, she is nervous.\\nRichards' story starts in 1960, when she was born in Dublin to poor, uneducated, ferociously strict parents. Her father, who sold scrap and firewood from a horse and cart, spent what little money he had on himself, while his children were underfed, underloved and regularly beaten. She was the fourth of 10 and grew up sharing a bed with her siblings. At school her nickname was Smelly because of the urine-soaked clothes she wore. She kept the family home meticulously clean, but was never thanked for it. The only present she received from her parents was a naked, one-legged dolly her father had picked up at the dump that she called Polly and adored.\\nOne day in the summer holidays, hungrier than ever without the daily currant bun and glass of milk they got at school, she and her older sister Deirdre nicked some apples and ran for it. They found themselves in the grounds of a local factory, whose middle-aged caretaker told her he had a bag of sweets and would like to give her one. He took her into the hut and said she just had to do one little thing before getting the sweet. He put her hand in his trousers and made her masturbate him, and said next time he would give her a penny. After that, she returned time and again for her penny.\\nA year later, her maternal grandfather, who lived by himself after her grandmother's death, took Richards' hand and asked her to do the same thing for him. He also paid her a penny. With it she bought the sweets her parents denied her – Black Jacks, Fruit Salads, Catherine Wheels, Refreshers. But she hated what she was doing, and began to hate herself. “I told myself I was worth a penny. That's all. A penny. Or a potato.” On one occasion, her grandfather didn't have a penny so he paid her with a boiled potato. What made it worse, she says, is that neither man was overtly intimidating. “If they had shouted or threatened me not to tell anybody, I would have felt better about it; that I had no choice. But I did have a choice, didn't I? I went round there.”\\nOne day, she told her mother what her grandfather had been doing. “I said, ‘Mammy, Grandda's doing things to me. And I don't like it, Ma.' I didn't know how to say it, I didn't have the words. She just turned around, so angry with me, and said, ‘Get out, you!' I just ran out of that flat.” She never mentioned it to her mother again.\\nThe family moved from Dublin to a council house in Derby, then Gloucester. Even though they had far more room than before, Richards' mother told her when she was 17 that there was no space for her or 18-year-old Deirdre, who had just had a baby. That's when they moved into the home of Fred and Rose West, who were known for renting out cheap rooms. “People said he's a friendly, funny, nice guy. He'd help anybody. That's what he was known for. He'd give you a lift everywhere.” The Wests picked up a number of their victims in the car when they were hitching.\\nRichards will never forget the first time she met the family. “We thought we'd be safe because there were loads of kids. He brought us in and he stood there and said, ‘This is my wife, Rose, this is my lover, Shirley, and these are all the kids.' And my first thought was, yeah right, you wish she was your lover, because she was a young girl, really nice looking. She was 17, the same age as me.” Shirley Robinson later confirmed to Richards she was Fred's lover and that she was carrying his baby, but still she didn't believe her. How could a girl her own age be with somebody Richards regarded as an old man, and how could his wife have accepted it? The more she discovered about Rose West, the less she believed it possible. Richards says Rose was usually screaming at her husband or children. She found her terrifying.\\nRichards soon learned there were multiple versions of Rose. One was simpering and prissy. When Richards' mother visited, Rose would address her in a sugary voice verging on the infantile. Another was boisterous, over-friendly and inebriated. Then there was the Rose that most horrified Richards. One night, Shirley led Richards into the living room and Rose was lying on a sofa in a see-through nightie and garish makeup, watching hardcore pornography and smiling silently at her.\\nRichards and Shirley became friends. She says Shirley seemed sad and confused. She didn't appear to have a bedroom and would hang about on the landing. Late one night, she saw her going into the Wests' bedroom. This was her routine; she shared their bed.\\n* * *\\nOn their first day at Cromwell Street, Richards, Deirdre and her baby were taken by Fred to their shared room. There were large holes in the wall. They stuffed them with paper, but when they woke up, the paper had been pushed through the holes and was scattered on the floor. This happened every night. They wondered whether Fred was a dirty old man, but preferred to tell themselves it was a game the children played. He appeared inoffensive, comic almost. He walked with a fake limp and constantly forgot which leg he was limping on. He made daft jokes, and worked on his own in the cellar or outside, digging up the patio. Most of the day and night he appeared to be hammering and drilling. “There was definitely something a little odd about Fred, but he seemed harmless enough, like a real-life clown,” Richards writes in Under Their Roof.\\nShe soon discovered a darker side. In the corridor, Fred would stand in her way, tell her there was no room to pass, press himself against her and pinch her bottom. “Lovely arse, girlie,” he would say. The pinches became more violent and left her badly bruised. He would wait for Richards, lunge at her and demand kisses. She says he smelled of “dead animals” and it made her nauseous.\\nOn one occasion, Fred attacked her when she walked through the front door, shoving her into the wall and banging her head against it. His elbow was pressed into her throat, choking her. When she managed to scream, Shirley emerged from the living room and told him to leave her alone. Richards told Deirdre she was terrified of Fred. He never assaulted Deirdre, Richards believes, because her sister was a stronger character. They thought about leaving Cromwell Street but had nowhere to go.\\nRichards decided to tell the police, but when she got to the station she couldn't bring herself to go in. She sat outside crying, asking herself what she could accuse him of, telling herself she wouldn't be believed and she deserved it anyway because she had allowed herself to be abused all those years ago. Fred was a married man with children, he was popular, he probably had friends in the police. “I wanted to say he's doing things to me, grabbing me, and I thought they'd just say, ‘Is he? OK.'” Instead of going in, she returned to Cromwell Street.\\nShe and Shirley bonded over ice lollies. Richards was working at Wall's and Shirley loved red ice lollies. On Fridays, she would bring a little box home and they would hang out together eating them. Richards didn't understand Shirley, but she liked her. “Lovely, she was. Real gentle. She must have had some kind of life before she went there, God help her. See, there's always someone worse off than yourself, that's what I say. No matter what I went through, there's people worse.”\\nDoes she still think about Shirley? Richards swallows and struggles for words. “Yeah.” She starts to cry. “Yeah.”\\nHer daughter asks if she wants to stop, and passes her a tissue. “D'you want to go outside or are you OK?”\\nRichards blinks away her tears. “No, I'm OK.” \\n* * *\\nAfter Richards had been with the Wests for a few months, Shirley disappeared. When she asked Fred where she was, he told her she had gone back to family in Germany. Richards and Deirdre thought it was strange. She was just about to have his baby, why would she leave then? Why wouldn't she have said goodbye? How could she have afforded the flight?\\nThe assaults on Richards grew more regular and brutal after Shirley left. When Deirdre went to visit friends overnight, she dragged the chest of drawers against her door as protection. But it didn't deter Fred. Another day, when Deirdre and the baby were away, she unlocked her bedroom door to find him lying in wait for her on the bed (he had a spare key). This time, she was saved by one of his friends calling. “Fred West had pushed me on the bed. His hand was over my mouth.” She refers to him as Fred West rather than Fred. She says it creates more distance between her and him.\\nOnce when she tried to escape, Fred and Rose grabbed a hand each and bundled her back inside. A neighbour saw it but did nothing. Another time, when Fred was attacking Richards, her mother dropped by just in time.\\nAll this culminated in the most shocking assault, again when Deirdre and the baby were away. In February 1979, Richards woke up to find Fred in bed with her, his hands all over her. She begged him to let her go. He told her he would so long as she agreed to watch a “special video” with him and Rose, and then he said, “We will have some fun. You get my meaning?” She promised she would, and told him she needed five minutes to clean herself up. After he left her room, she crept to the front door, barefoot and in her pyjamas, nudged it open and bolted to the bus station to wait for Deirdre and the baby to return. When her sister's bus finally got in, she told her what had happened and said she could never return to Cromwell Street. Deirdre told her they would go back to collect their things and leave first thing in the morning. Richards stood guard all night. The next day, Deirdre moved to Derby to stay with her boyfriend and Richards moved in with her brother Danny.\\nAfter she left Cromwell Street, she met a man she liked. He became her first boyfriend and she got pregnant. Richards thought she was too young and messed up to have the baby, so she had an abortion, which led to the end of what had been a happy relationship. Soon after, at 19, she took an overdose. “It was still all in my head. I felt dirty. Ashamed. Worthless.” She thought of all the abuse: the caretaker, her grandfather, West. “I felt as low as anybody could feel. I felt the walls were closing in. What have I got to live for? It was just horrible. All I could see was Fred West's face. I was hallucinating and his face was there in my face staring, saying, ‘Come on, come on, come on!'” Her brother discovered Richards after she overdosed, and she was taken to hospital.\\nRichards recovered and moved back to Dublin. She went on to marry and have two children, John and Jess, with her first husband, Callum. When Jess was three, Richards and Callum separated. She says a contributory factor was her problems with intimacy – in bed, she was haunted by images of her abusers. She associated sex with control, pain and shame.\\nNow a single mother, she moved back to Gloucester; despite the memories of Cromwell Street, most of her family and friends still lived in the city. She and the children quickly settled down. John was at school, Jess was in nursery, and she was peeling onions for a chicken curry when the news bulletin came on the radio. It was early February 1994. The lead story was about a search for human remains in a house in Gloucester. The newsreader said, “Frederick West, aged 52, and his 40-year-old wife, Rosemary, of 25 Cromwell Street, have been arrested on suspicion of multiple murders.”\\nHow did she feel when she heard that? “Absolutely horrific. Complete shock.” She's welling up. “There weren't any words. I rang Deirdre, said hello and she said, ‘I know.' We didn't speak, just held the phone. I could hear her breathing. She could hear me. I was ill for a long time after that. Stomachaches, headaches. The shock affected my whole body.” She and Deirdre, who died last year, never spoke about West again.\\nAmong the victims, the remains of Shirley Robinson and her baby were found buried in the Wests' garden. “I thought about Shirley a hell of a lot after they found her. How come I didn't see that, why did I not know? A million questions.” She pauses. “I might have had that survivor's guilt,” she says with typical understatement.\\nHad she thought of Shirley in the intervening years? “Yes, I used to dream of her. She'd be knocking on my door with a baby in her arms.” She sniffs back her tears.\\nAfter the discovery of the remains, she saw her past life through a different lens. It became apparent that the Wests had been grooming her as Shirley's successor. “That's the scary bit,” Richards says. “I know that now, but obviously then I didn't.”\\nShe thought about the endless drilling and digging. “We thought he was building a swimming pool. We really did. I remember looking out of the window thinking, it's not going to be very big. To think what was actually happening, and we were laughing. It's sick.” She remembered how he had smelt of dead animals, and realised it was probably the stench of his victims.\\nDid she have nightmares? “I didn't have dreams. I didn't sleep much when it all came out.” For how long? “A long, long time.” She thought about it constantly when she was awake. When friends who knew she had lived there asked about it, she'd tell them she'd only been there a few days and seen nothing. But she had\\xa0lived there about 15 months and seen too much.\\nThe police asked for a witness statement. Richards didn't say she had been abused, but she told them all she knew about Shirley. Her son overheard some of the conversation and she had to admit to him she had lived in the house. “He ran in saying, ‘So you were living there?' I hadn't wanted the children to know.”\\nIt's amazing to have gone through all that and not burdened your family with it, I say. “That's the last thing you want to do, isn't it?” Well, plenty of people would, and it's incredible you didn't. Richards smiles. “Is that a compliment?” she asks. “Thank you.” What impact has experiencing such horror had on her life? Again she smiles. “I'm a very busy person. The house is sparkling.” \\nRichards went into the caring professions, working with elderly people in a home and fostering children. She says fostering in particular has been shaped by her life experience. “I thought I could help these children because I've been abused, I've been through a lot, maybe I can understand them. And I think I did. At Christmas, one of the social workers came round and saw the tree with all the presents and said, ‘I'm moving in here!'”\\n“She downplays herself all the time,” Hannah says. “I've just never wanted for anything, and nor did the foster children. I was given a perfect childhood.”\\nRichards looks at her tenderly. “D'you feel loved?” \\n“Every day!” Hannah says. “Every day! Of course I do.”\\nRichards says she never felt loved as a child. The opposite. Her mother died a couple of years ago. Did she soften towards the end? “No. And my dad was worse.”\\nYet she believes her mother probably saved her life. The Wests picked the most vulnerable people to be their victims – young women who weren't in touch with their families or were remote from them (as well as their own 16-year-old daughter Heather, Fred's first wife Catherine Costello and her eight-year-old daughter Charmaine). Only six of the 12 known murder victims had been reported missing. But the Wests knew Richards' mother was likely to ask questions. “I think if it wasn't for her coming every now and again, I would have been gone.”\\nOn 1 January 1995, after 11 months in custody awaiting trial, Fred West took his own life. How did Richards feel about that? “At first I was delighted. I thought: great, he's gone off the planet, he can't hurt anyone else. Horrible, evil man, you don't deserve to breathe the same air as us. Then a bit later it was, like, what about all those families? They're not going to get any justice now.”\\nIn November 1995, Rose West was convicted of 10 murders. She had claimed never to have met some of the victims buried at 25 Cromwell Street, including Shirley Robinson. Richards gave evidence for the prosecution contradicting that. “She sat there saying she didn't know Shirley, but she did. I knew that. So that helped convict her. When I was in the court, I kept looking over and thinking, I wonder if she remembers me. Then I was terrified in case she did remember and she'd go, ‘Yes, and this happened and this happened.'” Richards was so scared because she still hadn't told the police she had been abused by Fred.\\nHelping to secure Rose West's conviction gave Richards some comfort. But she continued to torment herself about the day she had not been brave enough to report Fred to the police. Even today she still seems to be doing so. “Someone might have listened to me in that police station. Someone might have checked it.”\\nAfter the trial, Richards continued with life as before – a great mum, always on the go, a much-loved carer and foster parent. She buried her memories as best she could. But abusers were still not done with her. By 2013, she and her second husband, Mike (Hannah's father), had grown apart, and they divorced. A few months later, friends encouraged her to go on dating websites. After two dates with one man, he started stalking her. This time, she did report it to the police. Two officers came to take a statement. The male officer, PC Darren Heath, returned to her house by himself the next morning. She thought he must have information, but he didn't. He started to turn up every day, making inappropriate sexual suggestions. Richards was now in her 50s and yet another man seemed bent on ruining her life. She hid when she saw him outside, and put her house up for sale. When he saw the sign, he uprooted it.\\nSix weeks after she reported the stalker, three officers turned up at her home. By now, she had lost all trust in the police. But this time it was different. They asked if she'd had any bad experiences with Heath, and told her he'd been reported for harassing vulnerable women who had sought police protection. This time she told them the whole story. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office by engaging in sexual relationships with three women he had met while on duty; he was sentenced to 45 months in prison. Another narrow escape.\\nThankfully, there is a happy ending to Richards' story. After Heath's conviction, she was offered therapy by the police, and for the first time she spoke about the guilt she felt that she was still alive and Shirley wasn't. She still didn't dare broach the subject of the abuse she had suffered. Meanwhile, she and Mike were becoming closer again. She told him she'd never stopped loving him and he reciprocated. In 2022, they remarried.\\nShe confided to Mike what had really happened to her at 25 Cromwell Street. Richards was still blaming herself. “When I told Mike the first time, I was in a bad way. I said, ‘If I'd only gone into the police station that day … ' and Mike was, like, ‘Well they wouldn't have listened to you. Another girl had gone to the police, and they didn't listen to her.'” This is true: Caroline Owens, one of the Wests' nannies, was abducted, raped and abused by the pair in 1973. She reported the crimes to the police, but the Wests inexplicably got off with a £50 fine. “It was only when he told me that that I thought, OK, maybe they wouldn't have listened to me.”\\nShe told friends about what she had suffered at the hands of Fred and Rose West. All were supportive. They told Richards her story could help others who have been abused. She began to understand why she'd been unable to talk about it. On the one hand, she was ashamed of what she had been through; on the other, she felt she hadn't suffered enough to consider herself a victim. \\nBut writing the book has been cathartic. “I was able to say something I've never been able to say today.” She looks so proud, but at the same time so diffident. What was it, I ask? “I was able to say I was sexually assaulted by him. I just said it out loud.” She comes to a stop. “I haven't healed yet, have I?” she asks quietly. \\n• Under Their Roof by Kathleen Richards with Ann Cusack is published by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown, at £22.

She did what many a lonely and frightened woman has done throughout history, on learning that she was going to have a baby, and pretended she wasn't. “If you don't think about it, it doesn't exist – something like that,” she told me, more than three years on.\\nBy the time she noticed the changes in her body, she had been homeless for nearly seven years. Before that, she had lived a comfortable, secure life in The Hague, with a man she had fallen passionately in love with. But the man had become controlling, she said, preventing her from working or seeing her friends, spying on her and eventually threatening her if she left him.\\nShe left him anyway, one night around Christmas 2014, and so opened a very dark chapter in a life that, to hear Romina, had already known its fair share of darkness – her parents' divorce when she was three; years of sexual abuse at the hands of a stepfather; her mother's many suicide attempts, the last of which, in 2009, succeeded; estrangement from her two half-siblings; and separation from her two sons (one of whom was just a toddler) after she entered into that last, abusive relationship, leaving them with their fathers.\\nHer ex had political clout locally, so Romina felt that the only way to prevent him from tracking her down was to disappear into the city's shadow world. The first night on the streets was the worst, she said. It was raining and cold. She didn't have enough money for a hotel, and the little she had, she knew she had to keep for food, so she walked, and cried. When she finally slept, after three wakeful days and nights, it was in a parking garage.\\nFor a woman alone, it can be a toss-up as to which is riskier, staying inside a homeless shelter or on the street, and except in winter, Romina preferred to take her chances outside. “It's strange,” she said, “but only six months were very hard, because you still have hope and you know a better life. After six months you don't know it any more, your brain goes into survival mode.” In her mind, all her ties of family and friendship fell away. Her sole preoccupations were finding food and a safe place to sleep.\\nRomina and I spoke via a video call, because she was still nervous about revealing her whereabouts. Her laugh is full-throated and her English excellent, given that she told me she learned it from Netflix. She has a mass of blond curls and was wearing red lipstick and had a tattoo the length of her forearm. She looked younger than her 42 years.\\nShe had two lifelines during those years, she said: an old school friend who let her wash and use the internet at his place when his girlfriend was at work, and Tinder, the dating app. She would have sex with men in exchange for a bed for the night. She was aware that sounded like sex work, but said she only chose men she found attractive. With one of those men the relationship was “Netflix and chill”. They always used a condom, but she got pregnant anyway.\\nBy the time it became impossible for her to deny her condition, the relationship was petering out, so she decided not to tell the man. She tapped a query into Google – “pregnant, homeless, what now?” – and up came a name she'd never seen before, Beschermde Wieg, which is Dutch for “protected cradle”. It was the name of a foundation that ran a number of “baby rooms” across the Netherlands, places where you could give up your baby anonymously, relinquishing – without judgment – any role in that baby's life along with any straightforward way for him or her to find you.\\nIn the moment, the anonymous option appealed to Romina. She fired off an inquiry, since the foundation also offered anonymous advice. That was how she entered into contact with the women who, by providing information and unflagging support, would help her turn her life around.\\nShe broke off from our conversation to reassure her son, now three, who was clamouring for her attention in the background. Like the vast majority of expectant parents who have enquired about baby rooms in the 11 years that they have operated in the Netherlands, Romina ended up keeping her child.\\nThe founders and staff of Beschermde Wieg insist that their rooms offer a caring alternative to the more controversial baby windows – also known as baby hatches, life windows or safe haven boxes – where a person simply deposits a baby in a secure vault, often in the wall of a public building, and walks away. To the dismay of many, this modern incarnation of the medieval foundling wheel has made a comeback since the turn of the millennium, proliferating in countries rich and poor.\\nBeschermde Wieg believes there are enough new parents in crisis – including victims of rape or incest, fugitives and the extremely young – that it's vital the option exists of giving up your baby anonymously.\\nAs Romina attempted to express her gratitude to the foundation, her English temporarily deserted her. Then she found the words. At the moment when her pregnancy forced her to act, she said, she trusted no one and had nothing to give. Without Beschermde Wieg, either she would have abandoned her child somewhere less safe, or she would be dead. “They saved us,” she said, simply.\\nInfant abandonment and infanticide – which are often mentioned in the same breath – are not subjects that most people like to think about. Even Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, an anthropologist and professor emerita at the University of California, Davis, who studied them for years in the context of her wider interest in child-rearing, finds them hard topics to discuss now that she is a mother and a grandmother.\\nThough typically rare, abandonment is documented as far back as records go. There's plenty of evidence it predates history, too, and even the emergence of homo sapiens. Hrdy has argued that men and women are strategists hardwired to enhance their reproductive success. A pregnancy carried to term is a huge investment of resources, and usually the rational choice is to nurture and protect that investment. Very occasionally, however, circumstances arise that make the rational choice to write it off – as painful as that might be. Those circumstances include economic policies that separate new mothers from their support networks, and social conventions such as an extreme preference for sons. In her 1999 book, Mother Nature, Hrdy quotes a chilling note penned by a Roman soldier to his wife in the first century BC: “If you are delivered of child … if it is a boy keep it, if a girl discard it.”\\nNo country collects data systematically on abandonment, making it difficult to see what is driving it at a granular level. Newborn babies abandoned or killed before their existence is officially registered may, tragically, pass under the radar. We do know that abandonment reflects changes in the socioeconomic context. Today, abortion bans and crackdowns on illegal immigration are among the factors pushing it up. In the past it was principally lack of access to maternal care, stigmatising of single mothers, and poverty. Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist at University College London who studies abandonment, calls it a “lightning rod” for society's ills, because it's in childbirth – when humans are at their most vulnerable – that the strains show first and most dramatically.\\nSo many dead babies – more girls than boys – were being fished out of the Tiber by 1198 that a Roman church had a rotating cylinder fitted into its wall. A person could place a baby in the cylinder on the street side and rotate it into the building – abandoning the child anonymously. By 1400, foundling wheels were to be seen all over Europe. You can still see one at the Innocenti, a hospital turned museum in Florence, where the wheel is covered by a grille that was supposed to prevent people from shoving in older children. Indeed, Innocenti, along with Esposito (“exposed” in English, as in “left out”), were once surnames commonly given to foundlings.\\nBy the late 18th century, abandonment rates in many European capitals had peaked, shockingly, at about one in four births, and Hrdy has written of “epidemics of foundlings”. Misuse was suspected – birth parents presenting themselves as foster parents to collect monetary compensation, for example – and the windows began to be phased out, to be replaced in some countries by consignment offices where you were required to identify yourself. Maternity care and social services slowly improved. Methods of contraception other than abstinence became available from the 19th century, and legal abortion from the 20th – though, of course, not everywhere. Then in the late 1990s – for reasons including the decriminalisation of abandonment, and academic and media interest in the topic – the baby window was back on the scene.\\nThe typical baby window is a vault in the wall of a building – sometimes a hospital or clinic, sometimes a fire station or religious-run institution. Inside is a cradle and occasionally also writing materials in case the person depositing the baby wants to leave a note. They slide up a window, place the baby in the temperature-controlled interior and close the window again. They then have a few minutes to leave or change their mind, before the window locks and an alarm sounds inside the building.\\nToday, baby windows can be found throughout the world, though they are concentrated in regions where access to contraception and abortion is restricted. The US and Germany are outliers, with about 300 and 100 respectively. Most countries have many fewer, and the UK and France have none (the UK doesn't allow women to give birth anonymously, France does). In 2024, a woman named Toyin Odumala, who was herself abandoned as a child, launched a petition calling for baby windows to be introduced in the UK, in light of the highly publicised case of three siblings abandoned a few years apart in the same area of east London.\\nSister Ancilla runs the home for mothers and babies on a quiet residential street in Krakow, Poland. Financed by a Catholic charity, the Family Accompaniment Foundation, the home currently has four women and their babies in residence. But it serves a second function, having a baby window – a “window of life” as it is called in the country – fitted into the wall on the street side.\\nThe Krakow window was the first to be inaugurated in Poland, in March 2006, at the request of Pope John Paul II. Three months later it received its first baby, a girl; since then it has received 24 others – 12 of each sex, including two sets of twins. The abandoned babies spend no more than a few hours in the home – the nuns' role is to care for them until an ambulance arrives, and inform the family court so that the adoption process can get under way – nevertheless some of these modern foundlings have marked the sisters deeply.\\nOne premature girl was left in a shoebox, Sister Ancilla told me, wrapped in an old T-shirt, with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached – and, it transpired, drugs in her system. This was before Ancilla's time but, she said: “There was a presumption that it probably wasn't the mother who brought the baby. She wouldn't have been capable.” The nuns also suspected that the woman might have been a sex worker. The little girl survived, and Ancilla believes she went on to be adopted.\\nPoland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, and the Krakow window – like the dozens of others across the country – is advertised through churches and welfare associations. Over the years, police spokespeople have been quoted by local media as saying that the number of infanticides has dropped in the Krakow region since it was installed – the implication being that it is saving lives. A similar claim is made by Swiss Aid for Mother and Child, the non-profit organisation that runs six of eight baby windows in Switzerland, and by Safe Haven Baby Boxes, the company that has furnished all of the US baby windows.\\nBut the data doesn't really support these claims. Given that poverty is a known cause of abandonment, it could be rising incomes that have driven down infanticide in Poland – or lessening of the stigma attached to unmarried mothers. Sherr distinguishes between babies abandoned to live and those abandoned to die. Most experts agree that baby windows have no effect on infanticide rates, because forensic psychiatric evidence indicates that women who kill their babies – many of whom conceal or deny their pregnancies, then panic when they give birth – experience a degree of emotional turmoil that precludes the planning and problem-solving that using a window entails. They could reduce the number of babies abandoned to live, some of whom will die accidentally, but the data is ambiguous on this point at best. About 700 babies are given up in Polish hospitals each year, on average, compared with fewer than 10 via the baby windows. The hospital route is safer for mother and child, but not anonymous. Nobody can say what would happen to those 10 babies if the windows didn't exist, and women were better informed about their rights and options. They might be abandoned in unsafe places, or their parents might choose the standard adoption route.\\nThere is even some evidence that baby windows encourage the very thing they're designed to combat. When the Danish government was deliberating over whether to introduce them, it commissioned Laura Navne and Marie Jakobsen of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, in Copenhagen, to carry out a survey of the impact of baby windows in 10 high-income countries. The pair's startling conclusion, published in 2021, was that “they increase the incidence of child abandonment”. The government decided against installing them.\\nThe Danish finding echoes recent historical research conducted in Italy, showing that abandonment rates fell after the foundling wheels were phased out in the 19th century. The wheels provided both a solution for poor families with more children than they could support, the researchers found, and a secret, socially acceptable way of getting rid of babies born out of wedlock. In so doing, they entrenched the stigma attached to unmarried mothers, while fathers were unaccountable. Today's baby windows operate in a different cultural context, but they too have that dual function, the study's authors argued – protecting infants and perpetuating a system that fails to tackle the root causes of abandonment.\\nAbout 20 years ago, in an unpublished but much-cited anecdotal report, Hungarian child rights advocate Mária Herczog and colleagues interviewed porters at a Budapest hospital where visitors to the baby window were captured on CCTV. The hospital had the particularity of being located in the city's red light district, and the porters related that most of the 16 babies left there over the decade or so covered by the footage were brought by men. Who those men were, nobody knows.\\nIt's impossible to generalise from such a small and unscientific study, but it does serve as a reminder not to assume that the mother is the one giving up her baby, or even that she has consented to do so. For Herczog, the windows cynically exploit the most vulnerable women in society, since it is often the same women providing sexual services and babies for adoption. She called the devices “profoundly anti-mother” and said that many women end up giving birth in unsafe conditions before returning to bad situations where they quickly get pregnant again: “It is not a solution.” In her view, a humane society would intervene earlier, helping women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and supporting them through wanted ones. Sherr agrees. “I always say the mother of the abandoned baby is herself abandoned,” she said.\\nTo be fair, Poland's Family Accompaniment Foundation and Swiss Aid for Mother and Child try to intervene early, offering counselling and support. But both are – or are perceived to be – anti-abortion. The founder of the Swiss organisation, Dominik Müggler, did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article, but among the 33 reasons to have a baby, posted on the organisation's website, visitors can read: “Because God wants babies to live.” Herczog finds it telling that where the emphasis is on supporting mothers and keeping families together, as in the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, the windows (or rooms) stand mostly unused.\\nIn 2016, the Swiss canton of Valais installed a baby box that is funded, not by Müggler's organisation, but by the cantonal authorities, who wanted it to be ideologically and religiously neutral. Their aim was to reduce the infanticide rate, said the paediatrician who oversees the box, Juan Llor of the cantonal hospital at Sion, who was personally sceptical that it would have that effect. Since 2016, seven babies have been given up for adoption in the canton's hospitals, but not one has been placed in the box. “If the baby box is used, that's a failure of care for the pregnant woman and the family,” Llor said, adding that his initial scepticism had been vindicated: the window had had no impact on the Valais infanticide rate.\\nThe residents of the Krakow mother-and-baby home are in no doubt that an anonymous solution is needed. Several of them wrote me letters telling me how, though they couldn't have imagined giving up their own babies, they could easily understand women in situations only slightly more perilous than theirs choosing that path.\\nBeschermde Wieg, the Dutch organisation that Romina credits with saving her life, thinks it has found a happy medium – a way to offer anonymity humanely. It was founded by Barbara Müller, who previously worked in child protection, where she saw too many children let down by a dysfunctional care system, and concluded that more needed to be done early on, to keep families together. So in 2013, in her home town of Dordrecht, she set up a home where pregnant women or new mothers could find temporary accommodation and support.\\nA year later Müller decided that she still wasn't reaching the most vulnerable women – those whose desperate circumstances forced them to hide their pregnancies and to abandon or kill their newborns. She shared her frustration with her friend Kitty Nusteling, a mother of five who was working in the private sector then, organising childcare for middle-class families. Nusteling realised that she, too, would rather help women in greater need.\\nAt the time, around five abandoned babies were being found each year in the Netherlands, most of them lifeless. “And you can ask yourself the question, how many babies are not found?” said Nusteling. She and Müller felt that many new mothers in crisis might just need some respite, and that if they got it they would eventually – and joyfully – take their babies back. They decided to provide that respite, in anonymity and with no ideological or religious slant. “We're pro-choice, we're not pro-life,” said Nusteling.\\nUncomfortable with the somewhat brutal image of a hatch through which you pass your baby, never to see him or her again, they conceived of a room complete with child-friendly murals, cuddly toys and a sheepskin-lined rocking chair. A person couldn't give birth in the room, but they could spend undisturbed time there, settling the baby in and saying goodbye to him or her – also, importantly, browsing literature about the other options available – before pressing the button that would signal the baby's presence, and leaving. Since Müller's plan contravened Dutch law, which protects a child's right to know its origins – a right enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – she decided to keep the baby room separate from the mother-and-baby home so as not to expose the latter to legal risk. So Beschermde Wieg, of which Nusteling is director of operations, was born in the converted garage of a volunteer's house in Dordrecht.\\nThe law could apply to anyone seen as enabling or provoking anonymous abandonment, as well as to the person actually abandoning, and the punishment could include a hefty fine and jail time. Müller said that the first time a woman brought her baby to the room, she was invited to the justice ministry, interrogated and threatened with prison, but the threat didn't materialise. Eventually she was summoned to an official hearing at the ministry where she just kept repeating her line: “You are reading the UN convention in the wrong way.” In focusing on article 7, about a child's right to know their birth parents, she explained that officials had overlooked article 6, which defends a child's right to life. Müller argued that a person could only wonder about who gave birth to them if they were alive.\\nIn 2019, the government changed its stance. Though anonymous abandonment remained illegal, operating and using the rooms would no longer be punishable. The foundation even received funding from the Dutch health ministry after that, though nowadays it relies on private donations to pay for the 14 baby rooms – 13 fixed and one mobile – that it runs across the country, including nine in hospitals.\\nIf someone wants to give up a baby in the Netherlands, the official procedure begins with the child being placed with a foster family for three months. At the end of that period, the birth parents have an opportunity to change their mind. If they don't, the baby goes to an adoptive family, but the birth parents have a say in the choice of that family. Their identity is kept on record, and the child can obtain it, if he or she wants to, upon turning adult.\\nBeschermde Wieg respects this protocol scrupulously, but it inserts the extra option of anonymity. Many parents in crisis are drawn to the baby room, Nusteling said, but few ultimately choose it. Of the roughly 1,700 who contact the foundation each year, 17 give up their babies, around two-thirds of whom later reclaim them. The foundation's goal is to reach the mother as early as possible in the pregnancy, and to help her change her situation – to get an education, say, or to escape a violent partner. It wants the rooms to stand empty.\\nBeschermde Wieg was vilified to begin with, but as it shared more of the nameless women's stories, the criticism became more muted. “People saw over 10 years that there were not long queues of women wanting to give up their babies,” said Nusteling. “It's not easy.” They also saw that the women weren't all illegal immigrants – a common misconception. There were some of those, but there were also Polish women providing Dutch companies with cheap labour; young, unmarried Dutch women belonging to a strict Protestant denomination; and middle-aged ones like Romina, fleeing Dutch men with political influence. Perhaps, adds Müller, they also saw that there could be courage – and sense – in sacrificing your own desires to give your child a better life.\\nDuring Romina's first exchange with Beschermde Wieg, she agreed to a prenatal scan four days later. It was January 2022. “The next day it was very cold outside,” she said. “It was raining and all my clothes were wet.” She fell sick and called the foundation, which arranged for an ambulance to pick her up. At the hospital she learned that she was three months pregnant. Technically she could still have requested an abortion, but having seen what she saw on the ultrasound screen, she decided that was no longer an option.\\nFeeling trapped and frightened, her mind zeroed in on the baby room. Nusteling and her colleagues dissuaded her from taking an irreversible decision too soon, and she agreed to a period of foster care. She gave birth on a Friday, in hospital, by caesarean section. Given that she would only keep her baby for a few days, the medical staff advised her not to breastfeed him. “I did it sneakily!” she said. The following Monday, the foster parents came. Handing him over to them was the hardest thing she has ever done, she said, but she felt she had no choice. She was still homeless. If she didn't give him up, child protection would surely take him away from her.\\nShe spent the next three months in a psychiatric facility, half the time sedated to help her cope with the emotional maelstrom that losing her baby pitched her into. “The first three weeks were awful because your body is screaming for a baby but there isn't a baby,” she said. After six weeks she saw her son again, as the law required, and decided that she would do whatever it took to get him back. A judge agreed that she could have him, on condition that she found them a place to live. Beschermde Wieg's sister organisation offered her a room in one of its mother-and-baby homes, and when her son was three months old they moved into it, taking a single bag of clothes.\\nRomina has some outstanding debts to The Hague city authorities. She is on welfare and feels guilty that there is no father figure in her son's life. But she is slowly getting back on her feet, and has re-established contact with her older sons. Last Mother's Day, they came to visit. She shows me a picture of her middle son playing with his younger half-brother, her arms encircling them both. All three are smiling.\\nWhen her youngest starts school, in a year's time, she plans to find work. She and Nusteling have discussed the possibility of her joining Beschermde Wieg, to advise women going through experiences similar to hers. She knows it won't be easy – for a start, she's the perimenopausal single parent of an energetic three-year-old – but she can't get over how lucky she's been, or how surrounded she feels by kind people. “I have a beautiful home, I have food on the table, I have a shower, I have clothes,” she said. “Every day feels like a dream.” \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\"]"

         "[\"Pro-Palestine protesters will be legally protected while marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday after a New South Wales supreme court decision.\\nThe bridge is expected to be closed for about five hours, from 11.30am, and additional police are being mobilised to observe a march that could include up to 50,000 people.\\nIn her judgment, Justice Belinda Rigg said “the march at this location is motivated by the belief that the horror and urgency of the situation in Gaza demands an urgent and extraordinary response from the people of the world”.\\n“The evidence indicates there is significant support for the march.”\\nThe Palestine Action Group has claimed tens of thousands of people will take part in the march across the bridge, protesting against Israel's conduct in Gaza and the starvation of children. Celebrating the court's decision, organisers declared on social media it would be an “immense march for humanity”.\\nEarlier this week, police rejected an application from organisers for it to facilitate the march. Police argued there was not enough time to prepare a traffic management plan and warned of a potential crowd crush and huge disruptions.\\nSpeaking after the judgment, the NSW police deputy commissioner Peter McKenna said police were now switching to preparation mode.\\n“We don't get into the politics,” McKenna said. “We enforce the law of the day and tomorrow these protests have been deemed authorised, so we will police it in that respect.”\\nHe urged all participants to follow directions and said police would act on any antisocial behaviour. Public order and riot squad police, mounted police, traffic and highway patrol and other units were being called in to work, he said.\\n“Nothing changes for us in the fact that [if] people … come in to do the right thing and have a safe protest, then we will facilitate that … we will work with them.\\n“But if people come in to commit any type of offences, antisocial behaviour, or anything else that puts public safety at risk, we will have no hesitation to take action.”\\nOfficials were expecting significant disruption to roads and public transport. Trains will still run across the bridge, authorities said.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nOnce the application known as a “form 1” was rejected by police, the supreme court was required to decide whether the protest should be considered as “authorised”, which provides some legal protections to demonstrators.\\nRigg said the fact the demonstration was likely to cause significant inconvenience to residents and others “is far from determinative”.\\n“If matters such as this were to be determinative, no assembly involving inconvenience would be permitted,” she said.\\n“To deprive such groups the opportunity to demonstrate in an authorised public assembly would inevitably lead to resentment and alienation.”\\nRigg noted submissions from Palestine Action Group's spokesperson, Josh Lees, who told the court a demonstration on the bridge would send an “an urgent and massive response” to the crisis in Gaza.\\n“The public interest in freedom of expression, at this time, in the manner contemplated, for the reasons advanced, is very high,” Rigg said.\\nRigg rejected any suggestion that her decision would condone any antisocial behaviour or violence at the demonstration or “ambulances not getting to hospital on time”.\\nIn a statement, the Palestine Action Group described the court decision as “absolutely historic”. The group said it would provide further instructions to demonstrators before noon on Sunday.\\n“This will be an enormous, family-friendly and safe event for everyone. The police are now working with us.”\\nThe court ruling means protesters will have immunity from being charged under the Summary Offences Act. This includes protection from offences like “obstructing” traffic – crucial in this particular protest.\\nHowever, police will still have access to a range of other powers to stem so-called “antisocial behaviour” or other types of offending. This includes showing prohibited symbols.\\nThe state police minister, Yasmin Catley, said the government “accepted” the decision.\\n“Police, we believe, will be able to handle the protest on the bridge tomorrow, so long as people are peaceful, that they listen to what the police ask them to do,” she said.\\n“But make no mistake, there is going to be massive, massive disruption. So our message is, avoid the city if you can.”\\nDavid Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the authorisation “doesn't give people the ability to engage in all types and all forms of activism”.\\n“It's really important for people who do attend that they follow the directions of organisers and marshals.”\\nRigg said a counter-protest against antisemitism, organised by the Christian-led group called Never Again is Now, would not be granted legal protections because “notice was served less than seven days before the proposed assembly”.\\nThe group had been planning to protest outside the Sydney harbour tunnel, in close proximity to the pro-Palestinian march. Rigg said police would have the legal power to direct this group to move on, or if necessary, arrest demonstrators for non-compliance.\\nThere is no authority to ban protest or deem it unlawful in NSW. This is because while there is no express right to protest in the state, it is covered in common law and by the Australian constitution, which the high court has found implies the right to freedom of political communication.\\nThe decision came after several NSW Labor MPs defied their premier, Chris Minns, by vowing to attend the march. Minns had earlier opposed the protest and said “we cannot allow Sydney to descend into chaos”.\", \"The contingent of neo-Nazis arrived at Flinders Street station about an hour before Sunday's anti-immigration rally was due to start.\\nA hundred or so men, dressed in black, strode across Princes Bridge in a bloc, weaving through the large crowd that had already gathered under a sea of Australian flags.\\nPlenty of people in the lead-up to the so-called March for Australia on Sunday, and many who attended, said that the widespread promotion of the rally by known neo-Nazis did not mean it was organised by them; or that the presence of the National Socialist Network (NSN) in the crowd did not mean it was central to the day's message.\\nEven if they were there, some said, you didn't have to agree with everything they said in order to attend.\\nIn Melbourne, however, neo-Nazis were not just central to the march, they led it, all the way to the steps of parliament. And the NSN leader, Thomas Sewell, when he addressed the crowd to huge cheers, clearly laid out the role he envisioned for “my men” in the “fight for [Australia's] survival” against “ginormous empires of the third world”.\\nMembers of the group went on to attack a First Nations protest site, Camp Sovereignty, in Melbourne's Kings Domain on Sunday evening.\\nIn Sydney, too, the New South Wales leader of the group spoke to cheers of “send them back” from onlookers as Australian flags flew in the background. Pamphlets were handed out for a far-right political party about the “plague level” of immigration.\\nAustralia's immigration figures are not at record highs. The government says the net overseas migration figure is down 37% from a recent peak.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nIn some cities, politicians spoke at the rallies. In the lead-up, parts of the media interviewed march organisers and showed the flyers on television.\\n“It was only about recruitment,” said Mario Peucker, an associate professor at Victoria University, of the presence of far-right figures on Sunday. “It was an opportunity to mingle with people who basically [are] their target group … presenting themselves as the only voice for them.”\\nVictoria police said it was too early to confirm whether the attack on Camp Sovereignty or any of the other activity complained about at the rally would be investigated as “prejudice-motivated”, the force's term for offences that could also be described as hate crimes.\\nThe first mentions of a “March for Australia” came after the Palestine Action Group's March for Humanity, when massive crowds (police estimated 90,000 but organisers said the figure was closer to 300,000) walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on 3 August to oppose Israel's actions in Gaza.\\nOnline, the event incensed several high-profile nationalist accounts, one of which made AI-generated images of the bridge covered in Australian flags.\\nSoon a TikTok video emerged from an anonymous account. Over stock footage of Australian flags, it called for rallies on 31 August: “We finally stand up for ourselves and take this country back.” The clip included footage from the 2005 Cronulla race riots.\\nA woman who goes by the name Bec Freedom online claimed to be in touch with the video creator, “a young kid”. In early August, she began responding to tweets from One Nation's Pauline Hanson and various online influencers with a poster calling for Australians “to rise” on 31 August.\\nIn an X space on 11 August (where live audio conversations occur on the X platform), Bec said messaging should follow certain steps: “So, protect Australian heritage, culture, way of life. Next step, protect European culture, heritage, way of life. The next step is protect white heritage. So it all means the same thing.\\n“By saying it that way, it is more appealing to the public. It's going to deter them from saying, ‘Oh, it's a Nazi rally, blah, blah, blah'. ‘Australian' is white.”\\nIn response to questions from Guardian Australia about the comments, Bec said: “Am I a nationalist? Yes. Am I white? Yes. So I guess I'm a White Nationalist.”\\nThe March for Australia website launched on 8 August and the ABC reported that an earlier version of the March for Australia websites included a reference to the white supremacist concept of “remigration” – the forced return of immigrants back to their country of origin. The ABC report makes clear it had been unable to establish exactly who was responsible for the website.\\nAs the date approached, there was confusion about who the organisers of the rallies were in each state, although statements on the March for Australia Facebook page distanced the events from white supremacists.\\n“In particular, recent claims by Thomas Sewell of White Australia are not reflective of the organisers nor the politics of March For Australia. We are not associated with their organisation,” it posted on 12 August.\\nIn a video on 22 August, Bec said she and other organisers were not members of any extremist group, and were not endorsing violence. “All we are doing is gathering en masse to fight for Australia,” she said.\\nThe rallies also brought together many elements of the pandemic-era anti-lockdown movement and others, but despite the messaging of the March for Australia accounts, Nazi groups clearly intended to capitalise on the events, with the NSN group White Australia issuing a press release in the lead-up claiming to have “positive ongoing contact with the event organisers nationwide” and promising that members would be speaking at March for Australia events.\\nBec said she was not in contact with anyone from White Australia. On the question of whether the marches were sites of neo-Nazi recruitment, she said it was “irrelevant to myself or March For Australia”.\\n“I can't comment on what took place in Melbourne, as I publicly withdrew from any organisation of the event,” she said. “But no, they [the NSN] were not invited to speak at the Sydney event, they took part in the open mic section after the designated speakers.\\n“The March For Australia events were for all Australians, no one was banned from attending.”\\nShe said there were plans for future events.\\nThe rallies come amid growing anti-immigration protests in the UK as well as the Trump regime's raids and deportation of migrants.\\nThese ties were recognised in March for Australia messaging, with the main account posting on Instagram in support of Operation Raise the Colours. This movement urges members to raise British flags around the country and post photos, and the 31 August events in Australia was praised in turn by British “patriot” accounts.\\nAurelien Mondon, a UK-based academic who attended the recent protests there, has written extensively about how immigration is often used by those on the far right to appeal to the mainstream.\\nHe also says it is important not to describe such movements as “populist”, even when they involve the support of politicians.\\n“When we allow the far right to be described as populist, we are incorrectly implying that they are tapping into what the people want or that they speak for the ‘silent majority',” Mondon and a fellow academic, Alex Yates, wrote in a piece for the Conversation last year.\\nIn February, Mike Burgess, Asio's director general, used his annual threat assessment to outline the spectre of the far right. “We expect nationalist and racist violent extremists to continue their efforts to ‘mainstream' and expand their movement,” he said.\\n“They will undertake provocative, offensive and increasingly high-profile acts to generate publicity and recruit.\\n“While these activities will test legal boundaries, the greatest threat of violence comes from individuals on the periphery of these organised groups.”\\nThere was a range of grievances on display about perceived immigration rates on Sunday, but it was clear for many that the return to an imagined white Australia was a central theme.\\nFor Jordan McSwiney, who researches the far right at the University of Canberra, the weekend's rallies brought to mind the 2015-17 anti-Islam and anti-immigration street protests of Reclaim Australia.\\nThis time, however, far-right groups were not shielding their involvement.\\nMcSwiney noted how “easy it has been for the NSN to basically use the shield of ‘ordinary mums and dads' to sell white supremacy to a big crowd of people who may very well have genuine concerns … that won't be fixed by stopping immigration.”\\nIn his view, the recent response of state and federal governments to these movements – banning known Nazi symbols, for example – has been a distraction, and has not made it meaningfully more difficult for neo-Nazis to organise and recruit in Australia. As has been the “softball condemnations” of some politicians in response to the rallies – and the presence of others.\\nFor Peucker, Sunday's rallies represent a new escalation that demonstrated how the views of some who consider themselves “part of the ordinary Aussie mainstream” overlap with the political agenda of openly white nationalist groups.\\n“It's not that white supremacy, which was present clearly yesterday, is something that the neo-Nazis in some evil, secretive fashion introduced into the political mainstream,” Peucker said. “It is something that has always been present in parts of the mainstream.”\", \"The text messages circulating around Sydney's Sutherland shire in early December 2005 explained precisely the purpose of the gathering. “Just a reminder that Cronulla's 1st wog bashing day is still on this Sunday,” one read. “Chinks bashing day is on the 27th and the Jews are booked in for early January.”\\nOn Sunday 11 December, more than 5,000 people, mostly young men, swarmed Cronulla beach. They wore Australian flags as capes, they had drawn the Eureka flag on their bodies. They were drinking alcohol and they were chanting – and they were beating up anyone who wasn't white.\\nWhile tensions had been growing in the area for months, the catalyst had been a fight between three off-duty lifesavers at North Cronulla beach and a group of eight men of “Middle Eastern appearance”. The 2GB radio host Alan Jones was outraged as his listeners told stories of the “lebs” and “wogs” at the beach, and he said he was in favour of “a rally, a street march, call it what you will. A community show of force” and urged his listeners to attend. Police said 26 people were injured, 104 arrested and 285 charges were laid.\\nMemories of what happened on that southern Sydney beach nearly 20 years ago provoked anxiety among migrant communities even before last Sunday's so-called “March for Australia”. But they have been recalled by many more in the aftermath of the neo-Nazi-led demonstrations, in which volatile confrontations culminated with dozens of black-clad men, including known fascists, allegedly attacking people at Camp Sovereignty, a longstanding First Nations protest site in Melbourne's Kings Domain. Three men were charged. \\nThe association between Cronulla and the March for Australia isn't entirely accidental. The anonymous TikTok video that called for anti-migrant rallies on 31 August coupled stock footage of Australian flags with news footage from the Cronulla race riots.\\nWhy was Cronulla a touchstone for the organisers of Sunday 31 August? Did we witness a repeat of it, or was it a marker of something worse? And what does it say about the prevalence of Australian racism?\\nCamp Sovereignty is a place that marks the dead: 38 Aboriginal people from around Victoria are buried there, their remains repatriated in the 1980s by Museums Victoria. The camp is both a vigil and a protest against the colonial infrastructure that continues to sideline the slaughter of Indigenous people: there is no memorial but a plaque set into a granite boulder. No path leads there from the road; no prominent signage points to it. A victim of Sunday's violence, who spoke to Guardian Australia, noted the grim symbolism of a white nationalist attack on such a site.\\n“Australia is an institution of racism,” the Camp Sovereignty founder, Krauatungalung elder Robbie Thorpe, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday. “It's the institutions of this country that have allowed this to manifest. They're running around saying stop immigration; they're immigrants themselves.”\\nAustralia has a long history of white nationalism, from the systemic violence inflicted on Indigenous people from the early days of British colonisation, to the White Australia policy and, more recently, its brutal offshore detention regime. Pauline Hanson expressed fears of being “swamped by Asians” in her first speech to parliament in 1996. A few years later, the then prime minister John Howard, facing re-election in the wake of 9/11 and the Tampa crisis, proclaimed: “We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.”\\nThe problem of racism in Australia is as bad as it ever was, Australia's race discrimination commissioner, Giridharan Sivaraman, tells Guardian Australia.\\n“The racist violence keeps on pouring out on to our streets on a regular basis and we're so quick to forget the last time it happened,” Sivaraman says.\\n“During Covid, we saw a huge increase in racism towards people of Chinese and Asian origin, including racist violence. During the voice referendum, we saw a mainstreaming of racism towards First Peoples. In the last year-and-a-half, we've seen a huge increase in antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism, and now, in the last few weeks, we've seen a huge increase in anti-Indian racism.\\n“Interpersonal racism is prevalent and our structures are allowing this racism to happen and in some cases encouraging it.”\\nSivaraman says he has “lost count” of the number of people from migrant communities who have told him over the past few weeks that they were scared, or feeling vulnerable, or unsure what to do. Members of Australia's south Asian migrant community also described to Guardian Australia their shock and fear in the lead-up to the rallies.\\nJana Favero, the deputy chief executive of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, agrees multicultural communities in Australia feel exposed and insecure.\\n“This country doesn't need to have a debate about immigration, it needs to have a debate about racism: it is something this country has never reconciled.”\\nWhile the noisy minority of neo-Nazis on the streets of Australia's capitals dominate news headlines, there is a disconnect with the broader Australian public. The electorate, at this year's election, resoundingly rejected the politics of fear and division, not only rejecting Peter Dutton from the prime ministership but voting him out of parliament entirely.\\nPolice estimate a total of 21,000 people participated in the March for Australia. Those numbers were dwarfed by the scale of the Palestine solidarity movement – between 90,000 and 300,000 marched in Sydney alone on 3 August – but they are not insignificant. And while both the Cronulla riots and the March for Australia were widely seen as racist, they differed in one important respect: the significant presence of organised fascists.\\nIn 2015, the far-right group Reclaim Australia held a series of anti-mosque demonstrations. The group presented itself as ordinary “mums and dads” but never quite managed to hide its neo-Nazi links. Hundreds attended their rallies, and politicians gave them a thin veneer of respectability: the then federal government backbencher George Christensen spoke at the Mackay rally, Pauline Hanson in Brisbane and later Rockhampton.\\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\\nThe group quickly collapsed into infighting, and subsequent fascist groups struggled to transform far-right sentiment online into a mass mobilisation. Now, however, they seem increasingly confident about heading on to the street.\\n“I think these guys are a lot more organised,” says Clement Fermier*, a spokesperson for the Australian antifascist research collective White Rose Society. “They have a plan and they started to enact it.”\\nPrior to the March for Australia announcement, there had been “months and months of neo-Nazi news sources seeding any story about ethnic crime into these freedom movement spaces, and priming people for, ‘oh we need to do something about all these non-white people',” Fermier says. The March for Humanity was the catalyst for mobilising them.\\nAs with Cronulla, the mainstream media contributed to publicising the events last Sunday, even as the neo-Nazi connections became clear. And as with Reclaim Australia, some politicians got directly involved. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and party member Senator Malcolm Roberts attended in Canberra, and the federal MP Bob Katter spoke at the march in Townsville.\\nThe protests were condemned as hateful by the federal government, but Anthony Albanese also said he had “no doubt” that “good people” would have been among the crowds – a comment that for many recalled Donald Trump's much maligned comments that there had been “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly far-right rally in Charlottesville, and one that was rebuked by the prime minister's own backbench.\\nAmid growing debate in federal parliament this week about immigration policies and the rise in far-right activists objecting to multiculturalism, the Liberals were also caught in the crossfire when the firebrand Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price claimed Labor was bringing Indian migrants into Australia to boost its electoral chances.\\nPrice described the March for Australia as “a pro-Australia march” attended by “quiet Australians” and a “demonstration of unity”.\\nThe comments also undercut moves by the Coalition to reconnect with culturally diverse constituencies, and a bid by the shadow immigration spokesperson, Paul Scarr, to draw a line under the opposition's harsh anti-immigration rhetoric deployed under Peter Dutton.\\nReclaim Australia attempted to paper over its fascist elements, but at the March for Australia members of the neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network removed their masks, figuratively and literally.\\n“In the recent past, they haven't been able to get out on the street the way they'd like to because they don't have the numbers. They have had to go out in the middle of the night to do their stunts,” Fermier says. “[But] this was out in the middle of a day in the city, and it's because they managed to rope enough people in to protect them.”\\nThe longterm consequences remain to be seen. Leading members of the NSN face serious criminal charges, while different elements of the far right squabble online and some attempt to distance themselves from the overt Nazis. The new manifestation of the right may yet fall apart.\\nBut the events of the past weekend show that a serious reckoning with Australian racism is ever more urgent, Sivaraman says.\\n“People only engage with this kind of open violence if they think they're going to get away with it or they think they've got the support to do it. And that's an enormous concern. That shows we've got a really serious problem.”\\n* A pseudonym\\nAdditional reporting by Ben Doherty\\nThis article was amended on 7 September 2025 to remove an incorrect reference to the Tampa sinking. \\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

         "[\"The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according to Home Office data.\\nThe data also shows that the government is processing asylum applications much more quickly, with 71,000 cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two years ago.\\nThe figures come amid growing clamour from councils to block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex should be removed.\\nThe high court judgment has led to ministers bracing for further legal challenges from across the country and pressure on the government to find other places to house people.\\nThe latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour's first year in office.\\nThere were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.\\nThe latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories.\\nFor the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021.\\nIn the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people – up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences.\\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the government's first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster.”\\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: “The action we have taken in the last 12 months – increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system – are crucial steps to restoring order, and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous government.”\\nOn Tuesday, the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell hotel.\\nAbout 140 asylum seekers must leave the hotel by 12 September after the high court imposed a temporary injunction against them staying there.\\nThe Labour-run Wirral and Tamworth councils are among more than 10 that are reportedly considering legal challenges to close hotels housing asylum seekers in their area.\\nOn Tuesday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, named three Conservative councils that were considering legal action in efforts to shut down asylum hotels in their areas.\\nAsked how many Tory councils were considering legal action, he told BBC Breakfast: “There are certainly a number who are actively considering it. Broxbourne, which is next door to Epping, is one of them. I think Reigate and Banstead is another, Hillingdon is yet a third.\\n“So, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at this following the Epping ruling.”\\nWhitehall sources said the government was expected to appeal against the Epping ruling.\\nCharles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Starmer's shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal.\\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed” but without indicating which ones.\\n“I very strongly urge the government – I don't know what they're going to do – to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed … and which shouldn't, secondly to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly to deal with this very troublesome issue: namely, do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely that they will be closed,” he said.\\nThe Democratic Unionist party (DUP) is also seeking to remove asylum seekers from hotels in Northern Ireland after the landmark ruling in England.\\nAntrim & Newtownabbey borough council has launched an enforcement investigation into the use of the Chimney Corner in Mallusk to house asylum seekers after a complaint by the DUP Stormont assembly member Trevor Clarke.\\nThe party – the second-biggest in Northern Ireland – would also lodge complaints about the other two hotels that house asylum seekers in two other council areas, Clarke said.\\nWednesday's high court ruling that the Bell hotel in Essex cannot be used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules paved the way for similar legal challenges, Clarke said.\\n“Housing asylum seekers in hotels without first securing a ‘change of use' through the proper planning process (from hotel to hostel or immigration centre accommodation) constitutes a breach of planning regulations. No one is above the law, not even government departments. If the Home Office or its contractors wish to place large numbers of illegal immigrants into our communities, they must follow the same planning rules as everyone else.”\\nThe other hotels that house asylum seekers in Northern Ireland were in the Causeway Coast and Glens and the Ards and North Down council areas, the Irish News reported.\\nHome Office spending on asylum in the UK stood at £4.76bn in 2024-25, down 12% from a record £5.38bn in 2023-24, government figures show. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration and borders activity.\\nAsylum seekers and their families can be housed in temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation, if they are awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved and there is not enough longer-term accommodation available.\\nWhen there is not enough housing, the Home Office, which has a legal obligation to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, can move people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites, such as former military bases.\", \"Good morning. Anger at the use of hotels to house asylum seekers has been bubbling all summer, sparking protests across the country, some of which have turned violent.\\nFar-right agitators have been licking their lips at the prospect of another wave of anti-immigrant riots to force a change in asylum policy. But the move away from hotels may be hastened by something far more mundane yet powerful: planning law.\\nThis week, Epping Forest district council became the first local authority to win an interim injunction blocking asylum seekers from being placed in a local hotel, leaving Home Office officials reeling and prompting questions about further legal challenges.\\nThe ruling has been seized on by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, who said the party's 12 councils would consider similar challenges. He also urged protests outside hotels across the country, hoping to replicate the “template” set by Epping Forest.\\nIf a string of councils succeed in closing down hotels, the Home Office might have to find alternative housing for thousands of people at short notice – forcing the politically explosive question of where that should be.\\nSo how did we get here, and can the government get itself out of this mess? To answer those questions, I spoke with Rajeev Syal, the Guardian's home affairs editor. That's after the headlines.\\nGaza | Israel has announced it is expanding its military operations in Gaza City, as the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned its approval of a huge new illegal settlement in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international law.”\\nUK news | Labour is preparing to kick off a new wave of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in England to build the neighbourhood health centres at the heart of its NHS 10-year plan.\\nUkraine | Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine's security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump's push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\nTechnology | Scotland Yard's plan to widen the use of live facial recognition technology is unlawful because it is incompatible with European laws, the equalities regulator has claimed.\\nHousing | England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were constructed the previous year, research has found.\\nWhen Rajeev spoke to a Home Office official on Monday about the case lodged by Epping Forest, “they were quite relaxed”, he tells me. “That changed the next day when the verdict came out.”\\nHe explains that the challenge centred around the argument that the owners changed the purpose of their hotel without informing the local council. The hotel had first changed into an asylum hotel, which was used to house asylum seeking families; then it changed again to an asylum hotel housing young men. The council argued this occurred without planning permission.\\nRajeev says the Home Office is right to be worried as the ruling has significant implications. “The 140 people staying in this hotel, unless there's a successful challenge, have to be moved out on 12 September at 4pm.\\n“It shows that if a council challenges the use of the hotel in similar fashion, it could take just a month from the start of the challenge to getting people out. And if lots of councils managed to do that, it could land the Home Office with the job of rehousing thousands of people at short notice.”\\nBut how did we end up here in the first place, with hotels as the main form of housing for so many asylum seekers?\\n***\\nHow did we get into this mess?\\nIn 2020, the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels was about 1,200. By 2023, more than 55,000 people seeking asylum (pdf) were living in them. The number has since fallen from that peak to about 30,000.\\nThe uptick stems from a ban on asylum seekers working, which was implemented in 2003, following criticism from the rightwing press that migrants were taking jobs from British people. Perhaps counterintuitively, this resulted in the government becoming legally obligated to provide accommodation for asylum seekers who, without the right to work, would otherwise end up on the streets.\\nThis is not exclusive to migrants. Councils must support Britons and other residents who are destitute and come forward as homeless. Asylum seekers who are housed and fed by the government receive £10 a week in spending money.\\nThe use of hotels specifically is another problem passed over from the previous government. As journalist Daniel Trilling explains in this informative piece, accommodation was once largely provided by local councils' housing departments, but this was privatised during the Cameron-Clegg coalition government's austerity drive. Privately run asylum accommodation then became the subject of growing scandals, with allegations that much of it was unfit for human habitation. Slowly, the government became increasingly reliant on hotels and other forms of short-term housing.\\nThis shift coincided with the Conservative government's failed attempt to rewrite asylum law. Ministers sought to make it illegal to apply for asylum after arriving through irregular routes, such as crossing the Channel in small boats, by stipulating that applicants would be deported to Rwanda.\\nConservatives now claim that this crisis is unfolding because Labour removed the Rwanda policy, which was meant to act as a deterrent. Rajeev disagrees. “There was no proof that Rwanda proved to be a deterrent. The numbers of people coming over increased over those three years, before Rishi Sunak left office,” he says. “Over that period, the numbers of people in hotels went up.”\\n***\\nWhat are the options?\\nThe options facing the Home Office now – if hotels are suddenly forced to stop housing asylum seekers – are politically toxic.\\n“They come down to putting people in flats or houses, in what's known as multiple occupancy housing (HMOs), or in large-scale sites such as barracks,” Rajeev says.\\nBut using that kind of accommodation for asylum seekers has also sparked protests. This month, plans to house 35 families in flats above local shops in Waterlooville, in Hampshire, have been scrapped after more than 1,000 residents gathered for an anti-immigrant protest, calling on the government to “stop the boats”. Critics also argue the policy risks adding further strain to the rental market, where competition for housing is already intense and rents have risen sharply.\\n“Barracks come with political implications too. When Labour were in opposition, they were critical of barracks,” Rajeev says. The Bibby Stockholm, a converted barge in Portland, Dorset, was decommissioned in November 2024 by the Labour government after safety concerns and protests.\\nThat said, Rajeev adds, this hasn't stopped the government quietly expanding the use of Wethersfield, an airbase in Essex, as a place to house asylum seekers.\\nThe government could still win on appeal against Epping's decision, arguing that the issue is national in scope and that its wider implications must be taken into account, Rajeev explains. “If they win, they can breathe a sigh of relief. But even if they do, this weekend will see demonstrations.”\\nSo even if this specific decision is overturned, the political damage is already done.\\n***\\nWhy is Labour on the back foot?\\nLabour came into office promising to “take back control” of the asylum system, a message aimed at reassuring voters worried about immigration and at blunting attacks from the right.\\nBy the government's own measures, it can point to results. The backlog of asylum applications has also fallen from its record highs, with ministers boasting that the rate of processing is up by 116% and that the UK has removed more people with no right to remain than at any point in the past five years. The government has also signed returns agreements with Iraq, Albania and Vietnam, and launched a pilot “one in, one out” scheme with France.\\n“It's tough on Home Office ministers who have made some progress over the last year, but then, like previous Home Office ministers, they just get terribly battered by events,” Rajeev says.\\n“It remains a mess and a huge headache for Yvette Cooper, who has been the chair of the home affairs select committee and shadow home secretary. She knows this job inside out. Angela Eagle is also a very experienced minister who understands how this works.\\n“Diana Johnson, who's the policing minister, also has a strong track record, as does Jess Phillips. They're all people who have a great record of actually getting things done and doing it well.”\\nBut by defining success so heavily in terms of enforcement and deterrence, Labour has aligned firmly with the right on immigration; leaving the party exposed if numbers rise again or critics demand tougher measures.\\n“They've really failed to launch any kind of narrative as to why refugees and asylum seekers bring something good to Britain,” says Rajeev.\\nBecause of that, the debate remains in Reform's preferred territory: a fight about who can be toughest on immigration, rather than a contest on Labour's own terms.\\nMihir Bose digs into the nuances of cultural symbolism in this fascinating opinion piece on what it means to be British.

This was based on a statement made by a government minister on Sky News. In fact almost all of the decrease in the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers took place before Labour came into government.\", \"Keir Starmer's asylum plans have been plunged into turmoil after a high court ruling blocked people seeking refuge from being housed in an Essex hotel.\\nEpping Forest district council was granted an interim injunction on Tuesday to stop asylum seekers from being placed at the Bell hotel, following continuing protests nearby.\\nThousands of people, including some rightwing agitators, have gathered near the hotel in recent weeks after an asylum seeker living there was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the town.\\nMinisters are bracing for dozens of legal challenges from other council leaders after the ruling. Home Office lawyers warned the court that the decision could “substantially impact” the government's ability to house asylum seekers in hotels across the UK.\\nThere were about 200 hotels housing about 30,000 asylum seekers at the end of March.\\nInsiders at the Home Office admitted the department had been left “reeling” by the ruling. The department is obliged to house asylum seekers until their cases are assessed.\\nReacting to the judgment, the border security minister, Angela Eagle, said: “We will carefully consider this judgment. As this matter remains subject to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.”\\nMr Justice Eyre granted the injunction after hearing the local council's complaints that planning law had been breached in changing the site's use.\\nEpping district council also cited disruption caused by the protests and concerns for the safety of the asylum seekers themselves.\\nSitting at the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday, the judge agreed with the council that an urgent order was required to stop the hotel housing asylum seekers. He said the hotel's owner, Somani Hotels, had until 12 September to comply.\\nThe hotel has been at the centre of violent far-right protests since an asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu has denied charges against him and is due to stand trial later this month.\\nA second man who was staying at the site, Mohammed Sharwarq, a Syrian national, has separately been charged with seven offences, while several men have been charged over alleged disorder outside the hotel.\\nBefore the ruling was handed down, the judge declined a last-minute application from the home secretary to intervene.\\nA barrister for the home secretary argued that a ruling in the council's favour would have a substantial impact on her statutory duty to house asylum seekers while their cases are considered, among other concerns. But the judge said the home secretary's intervention was unnecessary and would merely use up court time.\\nSpeaking after Tuesday's ruling, the council's leader, Chris Whitbread, said: “I am delighted. This is great news for our residents. The last few weeks have placed an intolerable strain on our community but today we have some great news. This is not the end of the matter. Having obtained an interim provision, the next stage is for the council to return to the court and seek a permanent injunction.”\\nSince 2020, there has been greater reliance on hotels to house asylum seekers, with 32,345 being housed temporarily in England and Wales at the end of March this year. Labour has promised to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029 by cutting small boat crossings and building new government-owned accommodation.\\nEnver Solomon, the Refugee Council's chief executive, said: “The use of hotels is completely unsustainable – and this ruling shows that the government's plan to wait until 2029 to end their use is not viable.\\n“Through our frontline work we see how protests and hostility leave people who have fled war and persecution feeling terrified and targeted in the very places they are forced to live. This makes an already traumatising situation worse and robs people of any sense of safety.\\n“Instead of relying on costly hotels, the Home Office should partner with local councils to provide safe, cost-effective accommodation within communities. But to end hotel use for good, the government needs to think differently about how we can speed up and improve asylum decision-making.”\\nThe council said last week it was seeking the injunction due to “unprecedented levels of protest and disruption” in connection with asylum seeker accommodation. Whitbread had said the situation “cannot go on” but the government was not listening.\\nAt a hearing on Friday, barristers for the council said the site's “sole lawful use” was as a hotel and that Somani Hotels had breached planning rules by using it to house asylum seekers. Philip Coppel KC, for the authority, said the situation was “wholly unacceptable” and had provided a “feeding ground for unrest”.\\nHe said: “There has been what can be described as an increase in community tension, the catalyst of which has been the use of the Bell hotel to place asylum seekers. It is not the asylum seekers who are acting unlawfully. It is the defendant, by allowing the hotel to be used to house asylum seekers.” He added: “It really could not be much worse than this.”\\nOne council leader said he would gather “more detail about what Epping has done” before considering a bid to shut down another hotel thought to be housing asylum seekers.\\nCorina Gander, the Conservative leader of the borough of Broxbourne council, said crowds had gathered in protest outside the Cheshunt Marriott hotel in Hertfordshire, about six miles from the Bell hotel in Epping.\\nGander said the high court's decision had set a “massive precedent” and added: “It's just given us this massive boost and precedent that we can do something now.”\\nNigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, hailed the high court decision in Epping as a victory and said he hoped it “provides inspiration to others across the country”.\\nThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, suggested those housed at the hotel “need to be moved out of the area immediately”, while the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, said “residents should never have had to fight their own government just to feel safe in their own town”.\"]"

         "[\"Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin as soon as next week to discuss the war in Ukraine, White House officials have said, although senior aides warned that serious “impediments” remain to achieving a ceasefire.\\nLate on Wednesday, the US president told reporters at the White House, when asked when he would meet the leaders of Ukraine and Russia: “There's a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.” Trump said there had been no specific breakthrough leading to talk of a meeting but that US officials had been working on it for “a long time”.\\nThe New York Times and CNN, citing people familiar with the plan, reported that Trump planned to sit down with Putin as early as next week, and then wanted a three-way meeting with the Russian president and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\\nTrump gave no indication where a meeting with Putin might take place. It would be the first US-Russia leadership summit since Joe Biden met his counterpart in Geneva in June 2021.\\nWhite House officials briefed US media about a meeting with Putin after the US special envoy Steve Witkoff met the Russian leader at the Kremlin on Wednesday. After that meeting, Trump claimed “great progress was made” during the talks on ending the war in Ukraine.\\nTrump later told European leaders he was planning to meet Putin one-on-one as soon as next week and then follow up with a meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the New York Times reported.\\nMarco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said he did not want to exaggerate the progress made during Witkoff's talks with Putin. “Hopefully if things continue to progress an opportunity will present itself for the president to meet with both Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy, hopefully in the near future,” Rubio told reporters. “But obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur.”\\nMany “impediments” to peace remained, he said, especially concerning territorial claims made by Russia, and there was no concrete proposal for a ceasefire on the table. “What we have is a better understanding of the conditions under which Russia would be willing to end the war,” he said. The US would then need to compare that with “what the Ukrainians are willing to accept”.\\nWitkoff's three-hour talks came two days before a deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war or face fresh sanctions.\\n“My special envoy, Steve Witkoff, just had a highly productive meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin,” Trump wrote on social media. “Great progress was made! Afterwards, I updated some of our European allies. Everyone agrees this war must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come.”\\nTrump gave no further details of what was discussed, and some analysts will be wary of reading too much into the comments, after previous claims by Trump that Putin was ready to negotiate resulted in little progress. Putin has given little indication he is ready to make concessions or willing to adjust Russia's core war aims.\\nHowever, there have been unconfirmed reports in recent days that the Kremlin could propose a halt to long-range strikes by both sides as an offer to Trump. It is not yet known if the possibility was discussed during Wednesday's Kremlin talks.\\nOn Wednesday evening, Trump called Zelenskyy, who was travelling back to Kyiv from a visit to frontline areas in the north-east of the country.\\n“Our joint position is very clear: the war has to end, and it has to be a just ending,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media afterwards. “European leaders also took part in the call and I am grateful to each of them for support. We discussed what had been said in Moscow. Ukraine has to defend its independence. We all need a long-lasting and reliable peace. Russia must finish the war that it started.”\\nTrump had promised to introduce secondary tariffs on countries that import Russian oil if no progress was made towards a peace deal by Friday. On Wednesday, he issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India's continuing imports of Russian oil.\\nIndia's external affairs ministry said it was “extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest”.\\nA senior administration official said further tariffs could come on Friday. “The Russians are eager to continue engaging with the United States. The secondary sanctions are still expected to be implemented on Friday,” said the official. \\nWitkoff arrived early on Wednesday and was pictured taking an early morning stroll through a park in central Moscow with Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin envoy who has played a key role in negotiations so far. Russian agencies reported that he left Russia early on Wednesday evening.\\nIt was Witkoff's fifth trip to Moscow in his capacity as Trump's lead negotiator with the Kremlin, but the first since Trump began taking a tougher line on Russia. Trump previously cut short an earlier 50-day deadline to Putin, claiming he saw no desire in the Kremlin to change its behaviour and calling recent strikes that killed civilians in Kyiv “disgusting”.\\nAfter Trump made the threat of further sanctions, the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev claimed the harsh rhetoric could lead to a direct conflict between Russia and the US. In response, Trump issued an order for two nuclear submarines to be repositioned.\\nTrump and Kyiv have been calling for a full and unconditional ceasefire to allow negotiations to begin, but even a pause in long-range strikes could offer welcome breathing space to both sides.\\nUkraine has hit Russian energy and military infrastructure with long-range drones, forcing airports to close. Meanwhile, Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities continue almost nightly.\\nOn some nights Russia sends up to 500 long-range kamikaze drones into Ukraine, and 72 people have been killed in Kyiv alone since May.\\nTrump's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is expected to visit Kyiv in the coming days, although no firm date has been set.\", \"Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes summit on the Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.\\nDuring a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy's insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war.\\n“I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.”\\nEuropean diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions.\\nDescribing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both”. “We're going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added.\\nTrump, increasingly impatient with Putin in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets the Russian leader in person.\\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow for the US president to agree red lines before Friday's summit with Putin.\\nNeither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump's meeting with the Russian president.\\nTrump said on Monday that he would seek to arrange direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, a proposal that the Russian president has rejected so far.\\n“The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin, or Zelenskyy and Putin and me. I'll be there if they need, but I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders,” Trump said.\\nHe said a deal may not be possible and that he saw the upcoming summit as a “feel-out meeting”, and that he would update Zelenskyy and European leaders if Putin proposed a “fair deal”. “I'll call him after and I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal,” he said.\\nMerz's office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.\\nIt is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.\\nEU foreign ministers were meeting in an emergency session to underscore the demand. The UK has also been pressing for wider consultations after Trump unilaterally announced last week that he was going ahead with his first meeting with Putin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nEuropean leaders say Russia represents an existential threat to the continent and that they should not be excluded from the process. Issues such as the terms of a ceasefire, further sanction pressure on Russia, any proposed territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine would be discussed with the US president in the virtual meeting.\\nThere is concern that an unpredictable Trump will be lured into making fatal concessions to Putin, and the meeting would be a chance for him to map out his strategy.\\nThe Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said he was optimistic that the US president would formally consult European leaders before his meeting, and said the summit between Trump and Putin filled him with hope and fear. \\nBrussels' top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But she added: “Any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.”\\nRadosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe's relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump's efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims.”\\nThe White House is insisting that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy.\\nMerz spoke with Trump on Sunday night to underline that he would prefer the US to impose further economic sanctions on Moscow before the talks. He also said he assumed Zelenskyy would be involved in any talks, but for Moscow it would be a concession for a Russian delegation to hold talks with the Ukrainian president since its invasion is predicated on not recognising the legitimacy of the government.\\nA joint statement on Saturday from the leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Britain, Finland and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Trump to put more pressure on Russia and stressed: “The path in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.”\\nPutin will go into Friday's talks believing he is making progress on the battlefield, Trump is desperate for a settlement and the Ukrainian people are also increasingly willing to make concessions for peace. But the Russian president also knows that if he makes no substantive offer, Trump will be under real political pressure to go ahead with long-promised broader economic sanctions against Russia.\\nLindsey Graham, the Republican senator behind a congressional plan to impose secondary sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, expressed confidence that Trump would protect Ukraine's interests at the summit. He was involved in the weekend diplomacy and is trusted as an intermediary with Trump by Ukrainian officials.\\nHe said if Putin did not offer concessions, he expected Trump to make countries importing Russian oil pay a heavy price, adding that this applied not just to India but also to China and Brazil. India is already due to face 50% tariffs later this month.\\nSpeaking on NBC, Graham said: “Militarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as tripwires to prevent a third [Russian] invasion. We want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed.”\\nHe added: “I want to be honest with you, Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian, and Russia is not going to Kyiv, so there will be some land swaps at the end.”\\nUkraine's leadership has long said that de facto it will not recover all the territory it has lost in successive Russian invasions, but with European support it is fiercely resisting a Russian demand that it should hand over territory in the Donetsk region it has not yet ceded on the battlefield, especially if there are no security guarantees for Ukraine or compensating land swaps by Russia.\\nEuropeans are insisting that no limitations can be imposed on Ukraine developing its own military capabilities or the support it receives from third countries, including some inside Nato.\", \"Good morning. Last night, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House flanked by a dream team of hastily assembled European heavyweights. Their aim: to coax Donald Trump out of pro-Russian positions he adopted after his Alaska meeting with Vladimir Putin last Friday.\\nThe meeting was a sign of both panic and resolve from Europe. The fact Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and more cleared their diaries at such short notice to fly to Washington is an indication of how alarmed they are by Trump's desire to move straight to a peace deal without a ceasefire – and his insistence that Zelenskyy give up Ukrainian territory.\\nProgress was made on US security guarantees, and Trump and Zelenskyy have said they will both be holding face-to-face talks with Putin – although the Russian and Ukrainian leaders still appear worlds apart in their demands. Macron said he had “serious doubts” about Putin's desire for peace.\\nFor this morning's newsletters, I had a chat with our senior international correspondent Luke Harding about the key points agreed in Washington last night, what it means for international diplomacy, and what is next for Ukraine. That's after the headlines.\\nTax | Rachel Reeves is considering replacing stamp duty with a new property tax that would apply to the sale of homes worth more than £500,000, the Guardian has been told.\\nUK news | Exposure to pornography has increased since the introduction of UK rules to protect the public online, with children as young as six seeing it by accident, research by the children's commissioner for England has found.\\nConservatives | Leaked WhatsApp messages show Conservative MPs are worried that their party's “piss-poor” messaging over asylum-seeker hotels is making the party look silly.

It was probably also a reminder to Trump of Europe's combined importance as an economic giant compared with Russia's much smaller economy.\\nThe European delegation included leaders of Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato. By arriving as a group they avoided another debacle like Zelenskyy's February visit to the Oval Office, where Trump and JD Vance chastised him as not showing enough gratitude for American military aid. Here is video of that meeting in case you'd like to remind yourself of the horrific blow-up that Trump thought was “great television”.\\n“The meeting with Zelenskyy and Trump was significantly better than their pretty awful encounter in February of this year,” says Luke Harding. “I think Zelenskyy was well prepared this time: he expressed gratitude to Trump on many occasions, handed a letter from his wife to Melania the first lady.” There was a fair amount of “sucking up to Donald Trump”, says Luke, and of European leaders not trying to offend him.\\nKey European demands are that all decisions must be made with Ukraine present, and that a ceasefire is a pre-condition before further peace talks. They were looking to understand what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement.\\nOverall, the atmosphere was good, says Luke. “Zelenskyy was even funny on occasions. When Brian Glenn – the reporter who mocked him for not wearing a suit in February – asked a question, Zelenskyy pointed out that Glenn was still wearing the same suit and Zelenskyy had changed his. So overall, the atmosphere was OK.”\\n***\\nDid they get through to Trump?\\nRather than concessions from Ukraine, the summit focused on arranging security guarantees in the event of a peace deal. Trump said the guarantees “would be provided by the various European countries [in] coordination with the United States of America”.\\nThe Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, described the development as “a breakthrough”. Membership of Nato is not on the table, but the US and European leaders are discussing “Article 5 kind of security guarantees for Ukraine”, Rutte said.\\n“What is important is that Trump said the US would play a role in providing security to Ukraine in the event of a settlement. You might consider that to be progress, but we don't know what it means,” says Luke. “As ever with Trump there is a huge gap between what he says and what he does.\\n“I suspect at the end of the day the White House will not want to do very much, but at least this was something tangible. The Kremlin appears to be quite annoyed – that is modest progress for Ukraine, depending on what the US is prepared to commit.”\\nTrump is still saying there is no need for a ceasefire – because he says he has stopped a number of wars without one. There appears to have been less movement on this issue. “The European position was that a ceasefire must come before any trilateral talks – that is common sense when Ukrainians are being killed every day,” says Luke.\\n***\\nHow did the meetings go for Zelenskyy?\\nLike Europe, Zelenskyy wants a ceasefire before any peace deal and is unwilling to make any territorial concessions. Kyiv wants Nato-like security guarantees sufficient to deter Russia from attacking again. As a reminder, Russia took Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and launched a full invasion in 2022, attacking four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.\\nAhead of the meeting, Trump had pushed Ukraine to give up Crimea and abandon its goal of joining Nato – both key demands made by Putin. But Zelenskyy stressed he had been able to present a clearer picture of the battle lines to Trump, whom he met in a one-on-one in the Oval Office.\\n“This was the best of our meetings,” Zelenskyy said, according to a statement put out by his office. “I was able to show many things, even on the map, to all American colleagues regarding the situation on the battlefield.”\\nLuke says: “On the substantive issue – which is how to get a peace deal – he correctly and deftly dodged a question on whether Ukraine was ready to swap land in return for peace.” This is Trump's preferred peace plan after his meeting with Putin in Alaska over the weekend.\\nSpeaking to reporters after the Washington talks, Zelenskyy said “we had a truly warm, good and substantial conversation”. The next steps in the negotiations turn back to Putin, and the Ukrainian president said he was ready for what would be their first face-to-face since Moscow's invasion nearly three and a half years ago. “I confirmed – and all European leaders supported me – that we are ready for a bilateral meeting with Putin.”\\n***\\nWhat did Trump get out of the meeting?\\nTrump previously bragged on numerous occasions that he could settle Russia's war in Ukraine in a day, but on Monday he said repeatedly that it was far more complicated than he ever thought it would be.\\nTrump previously favoured Kyiv's proposal for an immediate ceasefire to conduct deeper peace talks. However, he reversed course after the summit and indicated support for Russia's approach of negotiating a comprehensive deal while fighting continues (for a reminder of how bad things are on the ground in Ukraine, take a look at yesterday's newsletter).\\nAfter the Washington talks, Trump said on social media that he called Putin and began the arrangements for a meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, at a location to be determined. “This was a very good, early step for a war that has been going on for almost four years,” Trump said.\\nUkraine's president said he was ready to meet with Russia in “any format” and that territorial issues were “something we will leave between me and Putin”.\\n***\\nWhat next for the war in Ukraine and peace negotiations?\\nMuch remains unresolved, including red lines that are incompatible – like whether Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine's army, and whether the country will ultimately have lasting and meaningful security guarantees.\\n“I think where it will go from here,” says Luke, “is that when a deal fails to come together and Zelenskyy fails to give away his land, Trump will start blaming Zelenskyy again, saying he's the problem.\\n“Ultimately as things stand, there isn't really a meaningful way forward to a peace agreement. I mean Putin's demands are as maximalist as ever – he wants Ukraine to give up a large chunk in the east of the country, in the Donbas region.”\\nAlthough this seems to be Trump's preferred route to ending the conflict, it is unlikely to work for Zelenskyy – were he to make this huge concession, Luke says, he would be swept away by popular protest.\\n“I think it's entirely possible that in the next month or so, the Americans will comprehensively exit from supporting Ukraine. Already they've stopped delivering weapons. I can see a pull-out from Trump,” says Luke.\\n“What I find so strange is the way Trump defends Putin, wants to include him, talks about calling him imminently, says he had a great meeting in Alaska. It seems ultimately that is where his sympathies lie – with Russia.”\\nThe New York Times describes 64-year-old Betsy Lerner as a TikTok star, for the following she's amassed since she started reading out diary entries that she wrote in her twenties.

         "[\"Hello, and welcome to TechScape. Johana Bhuiyan and Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who's enjoying the beach but likely getting sunburned.\\nTech companies are fighting to claim the title of having the world's most advanced AI. The goal is to supercharge their bottom line and keep investors and Wall Street happy. But developing the world's most advanced AI means spending billions on data centers and other physical infrastructure to house and power the supercomputers needed for AI. It also means a drain on natural resources and the grid in the areas surrounding data centers worldwide.\\nStill, last week's earnings reports made clear that tech firms are forging ahead. Google announced it was planning to spend $85bn on building out its AI and cloud infrastructure just in 2025 – $10bn more than it initially predicted. And the company expects that spending to increase again in 2026. For context, Google reported $94bn in revenue in the second quarter of this year. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said Google is in a “tight supply environment” when it comes to the infrastructure needed to support AI processing and compute. The results of this increased spending would still take years to be realized, he said.\\nGoogle isn't alone. Amazon has said it plans to spend $100bn in 2025 – the “vast majority” of which will go to powering the AI capabilities of its cloud division. As a point of comparison, Amazon spent just under $80bn in 2024.\\n“Sometimes people make the assumption that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component … that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology,” said Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy during an earnings call in February. “We've never seen that to be the case.”\\nMeta, too, has upped the amount it plans to spend on AI infrastructure. In June, Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to spend “hundreds of billions” of dollars on building out a network of massive data centers across the US including one that the firm expects to be up and running in 2026. Originally, executives said the firm was projected to spend $65bn in 2025 but adjusted that to anywhere between $64bn and $72bn.\\nMeta and Amazon report earnings this week.\\nArtificial intelligence companies have come under fire for cannibalizing creative industries. Artists have seen their work used without their permission as companies train their algorithms. Creative teams have shrunk and been laid off as parts of their work are being done by AI.\\n“It will mean that 95% of what marketers use agencies, strategists, and creative professionals for today will easily, nearly instantly, and at almost no cost be handled by AI,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has said. “No problem.”\\nIn response, coalitions of artists have launched several copyright lawsuits against the top AI companies, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic. The companies say that under the “fair use” doctrine they should be able to use copyrighted material for free and without consent. Artists, including names such as Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, say the companies shouldn't be able to profit off their work. So far, the AI companies are winning.\\nAdobe, the software company best known for making creative tools such as Photoshop, says it's trying to walk the line between developing useful AI programs and making sure artists aren't getting the short end of the stick.\\nThe company has introduced two “creator-safe” tools, that aim to tackle issues around copyright and intellectual property. One is its Firefly AI model, which Adobe says is trained only on licensed or public-domain content. The other is the Adobe Content Authenticity web app, which lets photographers and other visual artists indicate when they don't want their work to be used to train AI and also lets them add credentials to their digital creations.\\nArtists can “apply a signature to it in the same way that a photographer might sign a photo or a sculptor would etch their initials into a sculpture”, said Andy Parsons, a senior director at Adobe who oversees the company's work on content authenticity. We spoke with Parsons about the burgeoning world of AI and what it means for creators.\\n***Q: What do you see as the biggest issues that creators and artists are facing with the advent of AI, and generative AI?\\nI think there's one prevailing issue, which is the concern that various AI techniques will compete with human ingenuity and with artists of all kinds. And that goes for agencies, publishers, individual creators.\\n***Q: Is Adobe Firefly one of the ways that Adobe is trying to address these problems and make sure that creators' work is not ripped off?\\nYeah, absolutely. From the beginning of Adobe Firefly, we followed two guiding principles. One is to make sure that Adobe Firefly is not trained on publicly available content. It's only trained on things that Adobe and the Firefly team have exclusive rights to use. That means that it can't do certain things. It cannot make a photo of a celebrity, because that celebrity's likeness we would consider guarded and potentially protected.\\nThe second thing we built in from the beginning is transparency, so knowing that something that comes out of Firefly was generated by AI. This is what we call content provenance, or content authenticity. It's making clear something is a photograph or made by an individual artist as opposed to made by AI.\\n***Q: What is the Adobe Firefly trained on?\\nIt's a combination of Adobe Stock and some licensed datasets. It's trained on things that Adobe has clear rights to use in this manner.\\n***Q: How do tech companies like Adobe avoid copyrighted materials sneaking into the datasets?\\nWe have licensed and clear rights to all of the data that goes into that dataset. There's an entire team devoted to trust, safety and assurances that the material is available to be used. We don't crawl the open web, because as soon as you do that, you do risk potentially infringing on someone's intellectual property. Our feeling is it's not always the case that more training data is better.\\n***Q: What does the future of human creativity look like now that we're living in this new world with generative AI?\\nWhen it comes to content authenticity, there's that “nutrition label” idea we sometimes talk about. If you walk into a food store, you have a fundamental right that's fulfilled in most democratic societies, to know what's in the food that you're going to serve your family. And we think the same is true of digital content. We have a fundamental right to know what it is.\\nLast week, the internet in the UK underwent a seismic change. As of Friday, social media and other internet platforms will be required to implement safety measures protecting children or face large fines.\\nIt is a significant test for the Online Safety Act, a landmark piece of legislation that covers the likes of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Google.\\nRead the Guardian's guide to the new rules.\\n18 months. 12,000 questions.

What could go wrong? I went to find out\", \"When the annals of 2025 at the movies are written, no one will remember The Electric State. The film, a sci-fi comic-book adaptation, is set in a world in which sentient robots have lost a war with humans. Netflix blew a reported $320m on it, making it the 14th most expensive film ever made. But it tanked: though The Electric State initially claimed the No 1 spot on the streamer, viewers quickly lost interest. Today, it doesn't even feature in the company's top 20 most viewed films, a shocking performance for its most expensive production to date. It became just another anonymous “mockbuster”, crammed with the overfamiliar, flashy signifiers of big-screen film-making: a Spielbergian childhood quest, a Mad Max post-apocalyptic wasteland, Fallout-style retro-futuristic trimmings.\\nAnother way of classifying The Electric State is as an example of the “algorithm movie”, the kind of generic product that clogs up streaming platforms and seems designed to appeal to the broadest audience possible. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, whose style might be politely described as “efficient”, specialise in this digital gruel; they also made the similarly forgettable action thriller The Gray Man, starring Ryan Gosling.\\nIf you haven't clicked on an algorithm movie, you've probably been offered one by autoplay. Often, the title obligingly lets you know what's in store: Tall Girl, a 2019 teenage romcom, is about a, well, tall girl; Uglies, a sub-Aldous Huxley sci-fi satire, is about a future in which cosmetic surgery is a rite of passage; in Murder Mystery, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play fish-out-of-water Yanks who turn Poirot on a European cruise. They may feature one of the new tier of stars, often big names but one level below those who are able to open films on their name alone, such as Tom Cruise or Margot Robbie. These actors – Sandler, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Lopez, Gal Gadot – had the most to gain from kissing the streaming ring. The current king of the algorithm movie is Ryan Reynolds, who starred in 6 Underground, The Adam Project and Netflix's second most-viewed film, Red Notice.\\nAlgorithm movies usually exhibit easy-to-follow story beats that leave no viewer behind; under this regime, exposition is no longer a screenwriting faux pas. A recent n+1 article revealed that screenwriters who work with Netflix often receive the note: “Have this character announce what they're doing so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along.”\\nIn this age of “second-screen viewing”, the content remains within cosy aesthetic lines, so as not to jar viewers out of their Netflix'n'chill stupor. The lighting has that bright digital look, but remains stolidly low contrast. The sound mixes are flat because they need to work across environments and devices: people are watching on everything from VR headsets to beaten-up mobile phones.\\nAlgorithm-friendly entertainment – trawling as widely as possible for viewers, fully or half-attentive – is putting cinema on a slippery slope, believes Ted Hope, the one-time independent producer who went on to head up Amazon Original Movies in 2015. “If you see people are enjoying ambient programming, [the temptation is] to give them what they want. I would say: don't give them what they want.” Hope quit Amazon in 2020 as it was moving away from auteur-led titles (Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea, Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden) and towards a more populist strategy.\\nAmong the streaming companies, Netflix is by far the most successful. It now has 301 million subscribers worldwide – 100 million more than its nearest competitor, Amazon Prime Video. Releasing more than 100 film “originals” a year, it is more prolific than even the Hollywood studios in their Golden Age peak. It expanded in the 2010s from its US base into nearly 200 countries and operates as a monolithic global distributor of entertainment. While some of its content is purely local, it also aims to select the most promising titles throughout the world and make them available internationally (as happened with the TV show Squid Game and the 2022 Oscar-winning German adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front).\\nNetflix's model, and its enormous success, gives it unprecedented influence over cinema's future. It's unclear how far the shape of that influence is determined by the algorithm. Certainly any Netflix viewer will have noticed the proliferation of films that seem to fit the category of “algorithm movie” – but they are not algorithmic in the sense of being directly machine-generated (at least not yet). The company's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, has denied “reverse-engineering” films from its data, telling Vulture.com in 2018 commissioning was “70% gut and 30% data” (though in an interview three years earlier, he had it the other way around). Netflix's PR department declined to let me talk to any of its senior executives for this story, but it reiterated the line about “the misconception that we commission by algorithm”. A number of the company's former executives, and others in the film industry, would only speak to me on condition of anonymity; aware of Netflix's current dominant position in the industry, and its caginess about its use of data, they fear it could harm their careers if they spoke publicly about their experiences.\\nSo what is going on inside the black boxes of the streaming platforms? To what extent are algorithms and data really driving film production – and if they aren't, where are all the so-called algorithm movies coming from?\\nIn the late 00s, Netflix's then director of personalisation, Todd Yellin, set himself a trifling task: completely redefining the taxonomy of how films and TV were classified. He was a dedicated cinephile and director who had made a well-received debut feature in 2006, the Brooklyn family drama Brother's Shadow. But working at Netflix gave him an opportunity to flex other skills. “I also have a mathematical side to my brain,” he said, “so I thought if you subdivide movies and TV shows into their constituent parts and tagged them accordingly, would that help put the right title in front of the right person at the right time?”\\nThis was his plan for refining Netflix's recommendation system; the process by which content is sorted and mathematically weighted in order to give individual users the most pleasing selection. Often referred to as “the algorithm”, it actually involves 10 or more interlocking ones.\\nAfter putting his toddlers to bed, Yellin would sit down in an old chair and raid his library of cinema books for ideas about how to classify content. He quickly went beyond the repertoire of traditional genres – horror, comedy, thriller – to begin tagging titles by subject-related criteria: “Is it about dancing? Architecture? Marital relationships? Then we'd look at emotions – how dark is it?” For tonal matters, he and his team assigned values from one to five or one to 10.\\nA new job position – “tagger”– was created to watch and classify Netflix content. Yellin remembers it as painstaking work. He and his helpers eventually devised what in 2014 amounted to 77,000 “altgenres” (there are very likely more now): the categorisations that also, depending on what the algorithm serves you, appear on the Netflix homepage as row labels, the categories of films you're offered. They run from the blandly familiar (“Adventure films”) to the slightly more specific (“Relentless crime thrillers”) to the infuriatingly broad (“Feel all the feels”). And then of course there's the “Casual viewing” supposedly rotting everyone's brains, the likes of The Electric State or Red Notice, an action-comedy that's a mashup of James Bond, Indiana Jones and Fast & Furious.\\nSometimes these row labels are automatically generated, based on underlying relationships between the altgenres revealed by machine learning. Every user is assigned a mathematical “distance” to each altgenre, based on how much or how little they interact with them on the platform. Aggregated across millions of users, this web of consumption patterns reveals unexpected correspondences, overlaps and affinities in viewers' tastes. One example was the overlap between audiences who liked Formula One and classic rock'n'roll documentaries; in that instance, the recommendation system might generate a category that combined the two.\\nThis deeper data architecture was a gamechanger for Netflix. Originally, the service had generated recommendations based on a five-star system of user ratings, but in 2017 Netflix abandoned this in favour of the altgenre-based system. “Moving from explicit to implicit recommendations was the big shift,” said Yellin. “Recommendations based on behaviour – what you actually watched and consumed, versus what you said you liked.”\\nThe streaming companies receive, through their user interfaces, unprecedented amounts of data. In 2017, Netflix logged 700bn “data events” – interactions with the platform in some form – per day. Not just whether you opted for something in “So completely captivating” or a sports documentary – but what device you watched it on, what time of day you were viewing, how many other titles you lingered over, whether you turned something off early, how many times you rewatched, and on and on. All nodes in the galactic data cloud the services use to decide what films and TV shows to put in front of us.\\nIt's not surprising that data culture is embedded in the way streaming services do business. After all, they were tech companies long before they were film studios. Amazon Prime Video is of course an off-shoot of the world's largest online retailer, while Netflix – which started as a mail-by-DVD business in 1997 – was similarly rooted in online logistics. Its co-founder Reed Hastings was originally a computer scientist and engineer. But as Netflix matured from a distribution company into a studio – producing its first TV show, House of Cards, in 2013, and its first film, the African war drama Beasts of No Nation in 2015 – the importance of data in creative decision-making has only grown.\\nLike most Silicon Valley outfits, Netflix likes to move fast. Within five seconds, to be precise – this, according to the pitch workshop document they hand out to potential collaborators, is the length of time within which the “audience subconsciously decides whether they will watch your show”.\\nA swift and unambiguous opening is a non-negotiable for the company; most of the film-makers interviewed for this article mentioned it. Screenwriter Aron Coleite was brought on to punch up the 2024 sci-fi film Atlas. His draft originally opened with the film's star, Jennifer Lopez, interrogating the severed head of a robot terrorist. It was deemed too left-field and Coleite ended up replacing it with a more conventional Swat team raid intro; he was swayed by Netflix's data demonstrating that viewers need to be hooked within a certain window. He feels that window is getting shorter: “I see it shrinking as attention spans are harder to corral.”\\nAt Netflix, specialist strategy and analysis teams are embedded within every division of the business. The strategy and analysis team in the content division helps value a prospective new title – whether acquired or developed in-house – by modelling its performance based on historical data. The company has been doing this a long time: there are talks available on YouTube going as far back as 2016, in which Caitlin Smallwood, then head of science and algorithms at Netflix, details how a film's predicted success evolved according to new elements added during pre-production, such as certain actors coming on board, or the reaction on social media to a teaser trailer. (Netflix later clamped down on this kind of disclosure, afraid it might be interpreted as the algorithmic adulteration of art.)\\nAccording to Smallwood, this process went as far as assessing pitch decks or scripts for elements that might boost or reduce their appeal. Director Cary Fukunaga mentioned a complex narrative structure in his 2018 big pharma miniseries Maniac being nixed because of the audience loss predicted by the data. “The algorithm's argument is gonna win at the end of the day,” he told GQ. Netflix's data teams were always developing new products to guide content-related decisions, including software that displayed important statistics (such as the relevant altgenres and other classifications) for every title in baseball card-style summaries, and a tool that rated the audience appeal of niche character actors.\\nSmallwood, who left Netflix in 2021, said that nothing was enforced on the basis of data alone. “With content executives, our team's goal was to enhance the creative process – not to replace it. We wanted them to consider what the data and algorithms suggested, even if they rejected it,” she said. When I talked to creatives, it was striking that persuasion rather than coercion seemed to be Netflix's modus operandi. Almost all the people working with streaming companies I spoke to said they were surprised by how little raw data they were given. During the making of films in particular, the note-giving process remained largely as it has always been, rooted in executive intuition.\\nThe company does issue house style guides, very probably influenced by data at some level. Some of these guides are narrative-related, like the pitch workshop one, which has a pretty generic set of screenwriting rules, like “Who is the hero, and what do they want?” and “The location should be a character in your story”. (Nothing so egregious as insisting characters announce what they're doing.) Sometimes these address aesthetic matters: a producer who has worked on one of the company's recent hit shows mentions a stipulation to ape the chilly David Fincher look. Yellow is apparently a resonant, usefully non-gendered colour when conceiving children's programmes, following in the Day-Glo wake of SpongeBob and the Minions.\\nThe most tangible data film-makers receive comes in the form of periodic performance reviews – three, 10, 30 days after release – practised by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. Often this consists of figures on viewership and completion rates; some people find this nebulous compared to box office revenue, the performance metric traditionally used by studios. There's also Netflix Preview Club which, unlike the performance reviews, allows pre-release tweaks to be made. The Preview Club is an early-access section for invited viewers, and combines up-to-date monitoring of how viewers interact with a piece of entertainment with more traditional focus group-type questioning. But it's not clear how much of this research film-makers themselves are privy to. Several tell me that it would have been helpful, as they made final post-production changes, to have had more granular data on audience reactions.\\nOften, what film-makers and executives told me about the streamers' approach to data didn't sound so different from the old Hollywood studio production-line mentality. Studios have always sought a rationalised and repeatable formula for success, from the typecasting of actors during the Golden Age to proscriptive screenwriting manuals like Syd Field's Screenplay and Blake Snyder's Save the Cat during the conglomerate era, and rigorous test screening. Script analysis software in the 2000s, like Epagogix and ScriptBook, tried to predict box office success based on story tropes and the personnel attached to projects; these were prototypic versions of what the streaming companies are doing now. If algorithms are a fixed set of steps leading to a controllable outcome, then the earlier development process, trying to line up the ducks of storytelling in the right order, was also algorithmic in a crude sense.\\nIn fact, more data has just intensified old-school Hollywood problems, such as how to get film-makers, and even the streaming companies' own creative executives, to trust it to guide artistic matters. Part of the problem is agreeing how to usefully interpret the swirl of data. The different metrics, and the importance assigned to them, changed constantly, said a former Netflix film executive. “I had more managers than I could count, and the success metrics changed just as often. You can have all the metrics you want but that does not mean you are making better decisions or creating more loved content.” Executives can also selectively interpret data to stack the deck in favour of their own projects, said a producer who has overseen a slate of films for Netflix. In its external PR, the company advertises the uniqueness and sophistication of its algorithm; internally, however, people are still trying to realise their own preferences and passions. “And they leverage the algorithm for that,” the producer said.\\nAnd film-makers and executives alike know the truth: when it comes to assessing the probable success of a title, data can only do so much. Netflix is diligent about predicting how titles will perform on the platform, regularly reviewing the accuracy of its forecasts and subsequently updating the models. But many major hits, such as The Queen's Gambit and Squid Game, were a complete surprise. William Goldman's famous maxim about Hollywood – “Nobody knows anything” – still holds.\\nBut if Netflix doesn't burden film-makers with data, and if there's no consensus about how to interpret what little data they do see, then what's responsible for all the familiar-feeling, paint-by-numbers content that's crowding your screen?\\nOne answer is that the data is in fact making decisions, just at an earlier stage in the process: it determines what does and doesn't get commissioned. Film-makers are unlikely to be aware whether their project was greenlit or turned down on the basis of what data or algorithms said about it. But I spoke to one agent who told me that, at one major studio, creative executives have been excluded from the greenlighting committee so as not to skew the decision-making process with old-fashioned artistic frippery.\\nOthers in the industry have different explanations for the glut of algorithm movies. Producer Neal Dodson, whose 2019 thriller Triple Frontier was a Netflix Original, thinks that executives aren't paying too much attention to the swirl and confusion of data; they're merely choosing to play it safe. “They wanna make great movies, but they don't wanna get fired,” Dodson said. “They're afraid if they do something a little too risky, they'll get fired. But if they don't do anything risky enough, people say they didn't make good movies. It's a rock and a hard place.” Maybe this conservatism – hardly unusual for Hollywood executives – is what has fuelled the algorithm movie, rather than anything truly algorithmic.\\nThere's a certain irony to still being beholden to the restricted thinking of the analogue era, said another former Netflix film executive: “I used to joke that, because of the acceleration of everything, Netflix had gone from being a very new media company to quite an old-fashioned media company quicker than ever before.”\\nAnother reason for tired, samey content could be the lack of oversight that characterised Netflix's growth phase in the late 2010s. Before that, it had supported auteurs who were struggling to get backing from Hollywood studios; this brought the company the likes of Bong Joon-ho's eco-terrorism action-adventure Okja, Alfonso Cuarón's memoir-drama Roma, and Martin Scorsese's long-gestating crime epic The Irishman.\\nBut around 2016, Netflix decided to change its approach. It flooded the platform with content, bankrolled by issuing debt (up from around $500m in 2013 to nearly $13bn in 2019). It scrabbled to deliver enough movies and TV shows to its expanding subscriber base; South Park ribbed the company in one episode, by having its executives answer the phone: “Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?”\\nA producer of an independent movie, who received more than $10m in funding from Netflix, said he was given no notes during shooting, and the company's executives did not watch the dailies. “They basically wired us the money; my impression was I shouldn't call them unless there was a house on fire. They have more money than any studio ever maybe, but they couldn't stay on top of all their films. You can't scale that quickly.” Many other film-makers I spoke to similarly claimed that Netflix largely gave them a free hand.\\nThis producer believes the lack of rigour and the lack of experienced film executives during the company's expansion phase hurt its quality control. On the one hand, this phase allowed the creation of left-field or brilliant works like Okja, the erratic art-world satire Velvet Buzzsaw, and Charlie Kaufman's I'm Thinking of Ending Things. On the other, it allowed reams of landfill titles with generic plots and shooting styles to pile up on the platform.\\nNetflix's expansion era came to a sudden end in spring 2022. The explosive, pandemic-driven subscriber growth of 2020 – when Netflix added 37 million new members – had petered out, and in the last quarter of 2021 and the first of 2022, it lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers. Wall Street responded: the company's share price dropped 57% on a single day.\\nThis caused a crisis of confidence within Netflix. The company capped its content budget at $17bn a year, ending the precipitous annual rises of the previous few years. The blank-cheque policy for big-name directors was also cancelled (romcom queen Nancy Meyers' $150m-budgeted comeback Paris Paramount was scrapped, for example).\\nAfter Netflix introduced a cheaper, ad-supported tier in 2022 and clamped down on password sharing the following year, subscriber numbers started climbing again. But the company is still trying to run a tighter ship. It appointed the seasoned Warner Bros executive Dan Lin as its new head of film in February 2024; according to the Hollywood Reporter, he got the job on the basis of telling the company “the movies were not great and the financials didn't add up”. It's too early in his tenure to judge him on his film output, but the expectation is that he will clamp down on quantity and budgets, while trying to bolster quality.\\nThis approach is compatible with what Bela Bajaria, Netflix's chief content officer, called the company's “gourmet cheeseburger” model – offering viewers familiar-feeling, mass-market products with upmarket production values. Spread-betting on an inoffensive mainstream, rather than riskily hunting down artistic excellence, is better for sustaining subscriber numbers. People might be drawn to a platform by a single standout title, but they remain on it when they know there will be a steady supply of good-enough titles.\\nAs Steven Soderbergh told Vulture: “The entire industry has moved from a world of Newtonian economics into a world of quantum economics, where two things that seem to be in opposition can be true at the same time: you can have a massive hit on your platform, but it's not actually doing anything to increase your platform's revenue.” A film's success is no longer solely defined by its box office performance; stuck inside a single streaming platform, it has been walled off from hard financial realities. Netflix's slippery viewing metrics have encouraged this disconnect. It used to define a “view” as watching 70% of a movie. In January 2020, the company decided that watching two minutes was enough to qualify. Now, it calculates the number of views for a film or TV show by the total number of viewing hours logged by all users for a title, divided by its run time (so as not to disadvantage shorter titles); better, but still a smeary average.\\nCertain film-makers – like David Fincher, who is contracted to Netflix – see artistic liberty in throwing off the shackles of the box office. Others see this new lack of accountability as drifting ever further towards algorithmic blandness. “The best thing you can do if your business goal is limited to audience acquisition is to get everybody to watch the same thing,” said Ted Hope. “Because even if you have that strategy of a regular cadence of supply, you know that what increases engagement is more people talking about the same thing.”\\nThere was once a notion that streaming companies – facilitated by infinite server space and bottomless catalogues – would find new audiences for more obscure film titles. But in an analysis of Netflix viewing data between 2016 and 2019, independent researcher Stephen Follows found that the company was even more reliant on a handful of big titles than theatrical box office: the top 7% of Netflix titles in the US accounted for 50% of views (compared to 41% of box-office takings for the top 7% of cinema titles).\\nIt isn't so much that movies are being made by algorithm as that, by continually surfacing the mass-market or safe choice, the algorithm itself has a flattening, coarsening effect on our overall tastes. It's intriguing that while the majority of Netflix collaborators interviewed for this piece praised their individual creative experience, most also expressed concern about how algorithms may be homogenising culture on a wider scale. “It is a fear of mine,” said the director of a major Netflix blockbuster. “There's this constant balance that we're trying to find with technology. Algorithms can be incredibly useful when you want a suggestion for what to watch. And they can also be madly infuriating and the stifler of originality and creativity. Both can be true.”\\nNetflix, or at least some of its former employees, are aware of the issue. Smallwood said that her greatest challenge was how to lead viewers into the deeper catalogue and avoid offering them only variations on what they've already watched. “We intentionally injected variety into people's personalised pages,” she said. “As if we're sprinkling in a few items that are not at the very top of the algorithm's list.” (The company has recently filed patents for innovations to this effect.) It even experimented with different ways that viewers could express their preferences in order to shape what they're shown. But “consumers don't want to have to work hard to find what to watch,” said Smallwood. “They just want the right thing served up to them.”\\nNot only do streaming companies have no incentive to promote diversity of content in the industry, said Ted Hope, but they have also destroyed the broader business model that makes diversity possible. When Netflix or another streaming service buys a film, it effectively demands that it becomes the single distributor worldwide; this model innately favours mass-market work that will travel widely. It has also rendered obsolete the old piecemeal tactic of pre-selling distribution rights in individual territories, which was often how independent films cobbled together their budgets.\\nThe trade analyst Tansy Kelly Robson pointed out that before the streaming era, even the traditional studios were incentivised to take on some more offbeat films. Though such titles had uncertain box office value, studios could generate revenue from them by reselling them to TV networks. But with the streaming companies' films corralled inside their own platforms, the newcomers have little reason to make adventurous work with value elsewhere. If they need to shake up their catalogue, they can cherrypick maverick indie work that performed well in cinemas or at festivals – without taking on the financial risk of developing them.\\nRobson noted that a prominent film might bring subscribers to a platform, “but it's hard to tell if that's [because of] the show or another extraneous factor, and cost per viewer makes it, essentially, a loss-leader”. That is quite possibly the case not only for more unusual offerings, but also for expensive algorithm movie misses like The Electric State. But it seems that what Netflix is doing is working – and that Wall Street is convinced for now. Since April 2022, its stock prices have steadily risen. Customers and shareholders seem happy enough with the platform's never-ending carousel of forgettable offerings.\\nNetflix may be back on track, but the algorithm movie as we know it is about to be super-charged by the next generation of automation: AI. The technology, by its nature, plunders the creativity of the past. For the film industry's purposes, its training data will include scripts, footage, soundtracks, editing patterns, special effects work, every conceivable domain of labour from Hollywood's last 125 years. Auto-generating all of these using AI will cost a fraction of doing them for real. But the gains in productivity and efficiency will come at the cost of further entrenching the algorithmic approach to creativity.\\nAI is already being used on the fringes of films. Netflix used generative AI to insert CGI characters into some shots in The Electric State and also to create a sequence of a collapsing building in the Argentinian sci-fi series El Eternauta. Amazon also used the technology for visual effects work in its biblical series House of David. But such examples are far from generating a film or TV series from scratch.\\nTodd Yellin believes ChatGPT is capable of writing a cookie-cutter Christmas movie now – but the potential blowback for trampling on human artistry wouldn't be worth the risk. Most interviewees I canvassed think we are still some years away from AI producing a boundary-pushing script.\\nThe streaming firms already auto-generate artwork and trailers, personalised for each subscriber. If, say, Good Will Hunting appears on the feed of an inveterate romcom watcher, their thumbnail image for the film would feature Matt Damon and Minnie Driver getting cosy; for a user who prefers comedies, Robin Williams would feature. For Yellin, this kind of use of AI remains on the right side of the line: “An important distinction artistically and perhaps ethically is between using algorithms and generative AI to create a movie or TV show versus using them to create a promotional piece of content.”\\nBut it's hard to believe that the streamers will stop there. Stephen Follows recently conducted a survey of patents being filed by Netflix and Amazon Prime Video; among the former's 500 filings are machine learning-based tools for editing and visual effects, while the latter has filed more than 7,000 patents in similar areas. Its innovations span every area from script analysis, to automated storyboarding, to synthetic audience simulation in which to test key concepts, to “emotion monitoring” that can track viewer responses in real time.\\nThe strange paradox of the streaming era is that as the quest to personalise entertainment has continued, entertainment itself is becoming steadily more impersonal. The user, and the fantasy of unlimited choice, is king. The auteur, and singularity of perspective, are now subordinate – and the tsunami of AI threatens to wash them away completely.\\nYellin is still trying to reconcile the industry's turn to optimised content with his passion for art that has personality. He quit Netflix at the end of 2022 to return to his first love, directing. He co-wrote and directed The 52nd State, a crime story about a Costa Rican IT worker laid off by Hewlett-Packard who gets embroiled in a scam. It finally started shooting this summer. But, returning to a radically altered film-making landscape, Yellin was taken aback at how difficult it now is to raise financing for an indie. “It's been a hard road. The model for making an independent film has shifted,” he admitted. “Many companies have stepped away from pre-financing independent films. Why put up the risk to fund them ahead of time, when they can pick the ones they want out of the litter later?”\\nWhy indeed? Luckily, he still had his connections, and his old friend, the Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, stepped in to bolster the project as executive producer; his first foray into film production. The billionaire tech mogul brings in the cavalry for beleaguered indie film: how's that for an algorithmically neat third-act plot twist? \\n• Listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here.\\n• This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to correct Park Chan-wook's name.\", \"If you have a mental image of a Nobel prizewinner, Demis Hassabis probably doesn't fit it. Relatively young (he's 49), mixed race (his father is Greek-Cypriot, his mother Chinese-Singaporean), state-educated, he didn't exactly look out of place receiving his medal from the king of Sweden in December, amid a sea of grey-haired men, but it was “very surreal”, he admits. “I'm really bad at enjoying the moment. I've won prizes in the past, and I'm always thinking , ‘What's the next thing?' But this one was really special. It's something you dream about as a kid.”\\nWell, maybe not you, but certainly him. Hassabis was marked out as exceptional from a young age – he was a chess prodigy when he was four. Today, arguably, he's one of the most important people in the world. As head of Google DeepMind, the tech giant's artificial intelligence arm, he's driving, if not necessarily steering, what promises to be the most significant technological revolution of our lifetimes.\\nAs such, Hassabis finds himself in the position of being both a booster for AI and an apologist for it. The Nobel prize in chemistry was proof of the benefits AI can bring: DeepMind's AlphaFold database was able to predict the hitherto-unfathomable structures of proteins, the building blocks of life – a breakthrough that could lead to myriad medical advances. At the same time, fears are ever growing about the AI future that Google is helping to usher in.\\nBeing an AI ambassador is the part Hassabis didn't dream about. “If I'd had my way, we would have left it in the lab for longer and done more things like AlphaFold, maybe cured cancer or something like that,” he says. “But it is what it is, and there's some benefits to that. It's great that everyone gets to play around with the latest AI and feel for themselves what it's like. That's useful for society, actually, to kind of normalise it and adapt to it, and for governments to be discussing it … I guess I have to speak up on, especially, the scientific side of how we should approach this, and think about the unknowns and how we can make them less unknown.”\\nIn person Hassabis is a mix of down-to-earth approachability and polished professionalism. Trim and well groomed, dressed entirely in black, he wears two watches: one a smart watch, the other an analogue dress watch (smart but not too flashy). He gives the impression of someone in a hurry. We're speaking in his office at DeepMind's London headquarters. On the walls outside are signed chess boards from greats such as Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Judit Polgár. He still plays; there's a board set up on a table nearby.\\nIt was the chess that started Hassabis down the path of thinking about thinking. Between the ages of four and 13 he played competitively in England junior teams. “When you do that at such a young age, it's very formative for the way your brain works. A lot of the way I think is influenced by strategic thinking from chess, and dealing with pressure.”\\nOn paper there's little else about Hassabis's background that foretold his future. His family are more on the arty side: “My dad's just finished composing a musical play in his retirement, which he staged at an arthouse theatre in north London. My sister's a composer, so I'm kind of the outlier of the family.” They weren't poor, but not super-wealthy. He moved between various state schools in north London, and was homeschooled for a few years.\\nHe was also a bit of an outsider at school, he says, but he seems to have known exactly where he was going. His childhood heroes were scientific pioneers such as Alan Turing and Richard Feynman. He spent his chess winnings on early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and a Commodore Amiga, and learned to code. “There were few people that were interested in computers in the late 80s. There was a group of us that used to hack around, making games and other stuff, and then that became my next career after chess.”\\nIn the 90s, the games industry was already working with AI. When he was 17, he coded the hit game Theme Park, in which players had to build a virtual amusement park. “The game reacted to how you were playing it,” he says. Put a food stall too close to the rollercoaster exit and your virtual punters would start throwing up.\\nAfter studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, then a PhD at University College London in neuroscience, he set up DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg, a fellow postdoctoral neuroscientist, and Mustafa Suleyman, a former schoolmate and a friend of his younger brother. The mission was straightforward, Hassabis says: “Solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.”\\nDeepMind soon caught Silicon Valley's attention. In 2014 the team showed off an AI that learned to master Atari video games such as Breakout, without any prior knowledge. Interest started to come from now-familiar tech players, including Peter Thiel (who was an early DeepMind investor), Google, Facebook and Elon Musk. Hassabis first met Musk in 2012. Over lunch at Space X's factory in California, Musk told Hassabis his priority was getting to Mars “as a backup planet, in case something went wrong here. I don't think he'd thought much about AI at that point.” Hassabis pointed out the flaw in his plan. “I said, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn't help you, because if we got there, it would obviously be easy for an AI to get there, through our communication systems or whatever it was.' He just hadn't thought about that. So he sat there for a minute without saying anything, just sort of thinking, ‘Hmm, that's probably true.'”\\nShortly after, Musk, too, became an investor in DeepMind.\\nIn 2014, Google bought the company for £400m (as a result, Musk and Thiel switched to backing the rival startup OpenAI). It wasn't just access to cash and hardware that convinced them to go with Google. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer scientists like him, and “saw Google as ultimately an AI company”, says Hassabis. He also used products such as Gmail and Maps. “And finally, I just thought that the mission of Google, which is to organise the world's information, is a cool mission.”\\nFrom his office window, we can see the vast beige bulk of Google's just-about-finished new office, where DeepMind will be moving next year. It's fair to say the reason the tech giant is putting so much into Britain is because of Hassabis, who insisted on staying in London. “Our first backers were like, ‘You've got to move to San Francisco,' but I wanted to prove it was possible here,” he says. “I knew there was untapped talent around. And I knew, if we were successful, how important [AI] would be for the world, so I felt it was important to have a global approach to it, and, not just, you know, 100 square miles of Silicon Valley. I still believe that's important.”\\nIn 2016, DeepMind again caught the tech world's attention when its AI defeated one of the world's best players of Go – a board game considerably more complex than chess. The AlphaFold breakthrough on protein structures was another leap forward: DeepMind has now solved the structures of over 200m proteins and made the resource publicly available.\\nBut the AI landscape shifted seismically in 2022 with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which captured the public imagination with its uncanny ability to tackle a host of problems – from strategy planning to writing poetry. ChatGPT caught big tech off guard, especially Google. “They really went for scaling, almost in a bet-the-house sort of way, which is impressive, and maybe you have to do that as a startup,” says Hassabis. “We all had systems that are very similar, the leading labs, but we could see the flaws in it, like it would hallucinate sometimes. I don't think anyone fully understood, including OpenAI, that there would be these amazing use cases for it, and people would get a lot of value out of them. So that's an interesting lesson for us about how you can be a bit too close to your own technology.”\\nThe race is now on. DeepMind has become “the engine room of Google”, as Hassabis puts it, and AI is being built into every corner of its business: AI search summaries; smart assistant Gemini (Google's answer to ChatGPT); an AI image generator (that can add in sound effects); AI-powered smart glasses, translation tools, shopping assistants. How much the public really craves this AI-enhanced world remains to be seen. Competitors are also raising their game. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others are investing heavily, and poaching talent from their rivals. Zuckerberg is offering $100m salaries for top researchers. Suleyman, who left DeepMind in 2019, is now head of Microsoft AI, which recently poached more than 20 engineers from DeepMind. He hesitates to call his former friend a rival: “We do very different things. I think he's more on the commercial applied side; we're still focused more on that frontier research side.”\\nThat frontier to be reached is surely AGI – “artificial general intelligence” – the pivotal point at which AI matches human intelligence. “I don't know if it will be a single moment. It may be a gradual thing that happens,” he says, “but we'll have something that we could sort of reasonably call AGI, that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 years, possibly the lower end of that.”\\nIn other words, we are in the final few years of pre-AGI civilisation, after which nothing may ever be the same again. To some the prospect is apocalyptic, to others, like Hassabis, it's utopian.\\n“Assuming we steward it safely and responsibly into the world, and obviously we're trying to play our part in that, then we should be in a world of what I sometimes call radical abundance,” says Hassabis. He paints a picture of medical advances, room-temperature superconductors, nuclear fusion, advances in materials, mathematics. “It should lead to incredible productivity and therefore prosperity for society. Of course, we've got to make sure it gets distributed fairly, but that's more of a political question. And if it is, we should be in an amazing world of abundance for maybe the first time in human history, where things don't have to be zero sum. And if that works, we should be travelling to the stars, really.”\\nIs he getting too close to his own technology? There are so many issues around AI, it's difficult to know where to even begin: deepfakes and misinformation; replacement of human jobs; vast energy consumption; use of copyright material, or simply AI deciding that we humans are expendable and taking matters into its own hands.\\nTo pick one issue, the amount of water and electricity that future AI datacentres are predicted to require is astronomical, especially when the world is facing drought and a climate crisis. By the time AI cracks nuclear fusion, we may not have a planet left. “There's lots of ways of fixing that,” Hassabis replies. “Yes, the energy required is going to be a lot for AI systems, but the amount we're going to get back, even just narrowly for climate [solutions] from these models, it's going to far outweigh the energy costs.”\\nThere's also the worry that “radical abundance” is another way of framing “mass unemployment”: AI is already replacing human jobs. When we “never need to work again” – as many have promised – doesn't that really mean we're surrendering our economic power to whoever controls the AI? “That's going to be one of the biggest things we're gonna have to figure out,” he acknowledges. “Let's say we get radical abundance, and we distribute that in a good way, what happens next?”\\nHassabis has two sons in their late teens (his Italian-born wife is a molecular biologist). What does he envisage for their future? “It's a bit like the era I was growing up in, where home computers were coming online. Obviously it's going to be bigger than that, but you've got to embrace the new technology ... If you become an expert, kind of a ninja, at using these things, it's going to really empower the people that are good at these tools.”\\nNon-ninjas will still have a place, however: “We need some great philosophers, but also economists to think about what the world should look like when something like this comes along. What is purpose? What is meaning?” He points out that there are many things we do that aren't strictly for utility: sports, meditation, arts. “We're going to lean into those areas, as a society, even more heavily, because we'll have the time and the resources to do so.”\\nIt's difficult to see Hassabis himself carving out much of that time, between DeepMind, his drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs and his endless public appearances – the list goes on. “I don't have much time that isn't working, seven days a week,” he acknowledges. “I spend time with my kids playing games, board games, and that's some of my most fun times.” He doesn't let them win, he says. “We play very competitively.”\\nHe's also a season ticket holder at Liverpool FC and makes it to “six, seven games a year”. He still plays chess online – “It's a bit like going to the gym, for the mind.” And he's a mean poker player, apparently. The night after winning his Nobel prize he celebrated with a poker night with Magnus Carlsen and some world poker champions. “In another universe, I might have been a professional gamer.”\\nSo, no fears about the future? “I'm a cautious optimist,” he says. “So overall, if we're given the time, I believe in human ingenuity. I think we'll get this right. I think also, humans are infinitely adaptable. I mean, look where we are today. Our brains were evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and we're in modern civilisation. The difference here is, it's going to be 10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.” The Industrial Revolution was not plain sailing for everyone, he admits, “but we wouldn't wish it hadn't happened. Obviously, we should try to minimise that disruption, but there is going to be change – hopefully for the better.”\\n• This article was amended on 4 August 2025 because an earlier version said OpenAI's “ChatGPT3” was released in 2020; that meant to refer to ChatGPT, which was released in 2022.

         "[\"Extreme politics and extreme weather go hand in hand, and both have to be confronted if we are to understand and overcome the polycrisis we are living through.\\nYet few media organisations are examining why the climate emergency is creating a new era of demagogues. Even fewer are scrutinising how those authoritarian leaders are trying to misdirect public attention away from the root cause of our current global malaise.\\nThe Guardian is different.\\nAbout nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take stronger climate actions, yet we've witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster.\\nPowerful governments, financial institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises and some are funding secretive lobby groups and far-right politicians that want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change.\\nThe pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly in the United States, now that the world's biggest fossil fuel producer appears intent on undermining hard-won progress on reducing emissions.\\nThe most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US National Weather Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up dam failure and cloud seeding.\\nThen there are rightwing media organisations that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events, such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive blackout in Spain.\\nMost alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”. This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their doomsday bunkers.\\nThere also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible.\\nThe Guardian has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain.\\nWorse could still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by climate change.\\nThe Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both.\\nEarlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European politicians since at least February 2023.\\nIn these bleak times, it is also crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian's earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions, and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in the world want more ambitious climate action.\\nWe are not alone. This is not a fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell us.

Tiny fragments – invisible to the human eye – are probably swimming around your lungs, blood and liver right now.\\nThis represents a “growing and underrecognised danger” to human health, the latest report in the Lancet warns, as 10 days of tense talks kick off in Geneva today, with 179 countries due to hash out a kind of “Paris agreement for plastic pollution”.\\nThese talks – which have been going on since 2022 – have been dogged by deep disagreements. More than 100 nations want a legally binding cap on plastic production, while petrostates want to keep things vague, and maybe promise to, errrrr, do some more recycling, perhaps? It's possible talks will collapse with no reference to cuts to plastic production.\\nI spoke to the Guardian's environment correspondent Sandra Laville about why the sixth (and hopefully final) round of talks are likely to be so fraught and what a good deal could look like.\\nWeather | Gusts of more than 100mph from Storm Floris have brought travel disruption, power cuts and the widespread cancellation of events across large parts of the UK. Disruption to the rail network in Scotland is expected until around 4pm on Tuesday, ScotRail has said.\\nUK news | A member of the House of Lords urged ministers to crack down on Palestine Action at the request of a US defence company that employs him as an adviser.

Since then, five separate negotiations have failed to secure an agreement. Initially, the idea was for the treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics, but plans have since been watered down.\\nThe last round of talks – held in Busan, South Korea – broke down at the end of last year. “There was some concern we wouldn't even get another meeting,” says Sandra Laville. Country representatives are resuming today for 10 days of talks in Switzerland.\\nAlthough plastic is often seen as a cheap material, it's expensive when you factor in the cost of cleaning up the damage it causes – the latest report found it is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages. And almost all plastic is made from fossil oil and gas. Producing all of this plastic results in greater emissions than those produced by Russia – the world's fourth-largest polluter.\\nAccording to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data, plastic production has increased sharply over the past 70 years. In 1950, the world was producing two million tonnes of plastic to more than 450m tonnes today. Less than 10% of the world's plastic is recycled, and more than 40% is stuck in landfill. “Single-use plastic is the big earner for lots of companies and the petrochemical industry,” says Sandra.\\nThere were a record 220 fossil fuel and chemic industry lobbyists at the December talks in Busan. That was far more than even the host nation's delegation of 140 and was three times the number of independent scientists. Hotel and flight costs make the treaty negotiations expensive to attend, which is why rich industrial interests can flood the talks with lobbyists while smaller countries, scientists and NGOs struggle to find the funds.\\n***\\nWhy is this such a pressing problem for human health?\\nPlastic is, in many ways, a wonder material, but the most rapid increase in production is for single-use plastics, things such as drinks bottles and fast-food packaging, which we sometimes use for a matter of minutes before chucking away. This sort of plastic may be a big earner for companies, but it is not essential for human wellbeing, and the drawbacks are significant.\\nThe latest review, published in the leading medical journal the Lancet, was carried out by leading health researchers and doctors. They found plastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age because they are laced in more than 16,000 chemicals such as fillers, dyes, flame retardants and stabilisers which have been known to damage human health.\\nThe most vulnerable in society are the most at risk. The analysis found that foetuses and infants were subject to harms such as increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth, childhood cancer and fertility problems later in life.\\n***\\nWhat are delegates going to achieve?\\nThere are two groups battling it out in Geneva. One is comprised of more than 100 countries – including the EU – which support legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of single-use plastic products. The other camp are countries with large fossil fuel industries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, who say they don't want any suggestion of tackling plastic production.\\nThe latter group want the agreement to focus on better management and recycling of waste, and for countries to implement voluntary or national measures. “Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China have moved the discussion away from production towards, ‘Oh we just need to manage the waste better, oh we just need to recycle more',” says Sandra.\\nSince 2022, these divisions have become more entrenched. Countries such as Egypt and Malaysia have plastic industry representatives in their national delegations. Meanwhile, the 100 high-ambition countries are not going to fold – the evidence shows we have to reduce plastic production to reduce pollution. “That's why it all collapsed in Busan in December,” says Sandra.\\nThe nature of any agreement is still up the air – it's possible a meaningful treaty will be agreed, or they have further meetings, or some countries agree to pursue a “coalition of the willing” treaty outside the UN. Greenpeace is calling for at least a 75% reduction in plastic production by 2040.\\nBut if an agreement can be reached, it would be the equivalent of getting the Paris agreement for climate negotiations. “You can argue the Paris agreement hasn't done much, but there has been an agreement, and we just haven't had one on plastic pollution. So this is the kind of vacuum that needs to be filled,” says Sandra.\\n***\\nWhat does this say about international environmental diplomacy?\\n“I think there was this real optimism in 2022 when the idea of a treaty was agreed,” says Sandra. Scientists were saying that getting a good agreement could be a gamechanger for cutting plastic pollution. But the winds appear to have changed. “By last November that optimism had all gone.”\\nThe US – which is the world's second-largest producer of plastic after China – has flip-flopped positions during negotiations, but now appears to be aligned with other major fossil fuel producers and is supporting the least ambitious option. China and Iran are also among the countries looking for less ambition, an option they describe as “realistic”. It comes as the Trump administration in the US rolls back environmental policies, including a longstanding finding on greenhouse gas emissions endangering health.\\nAndrés del Castillo, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a non profit providing legal counsel to some countries attending the talks, said oil states were questioning even basic facts about the harm to health caused by plastics. “We are in a moment of revisionism, where even science is highly politicised,” he says.\\nHopes for a “last-chance” ambitious global treaty to curb plastic pollution are looking dim – but a weaker agreement still shows international diplomacy functions. “It doesn't feel as if the world is ready to address any of this,” says Sandra. “I do think that any treaty – as long as it's not really weak – is a good thing to hold up.”\\nNels Abbey is compelling in this column on Kemi Badenoch's “comedic, but sadly revealing” rejection of her Nigerian heritage – not least, he writes, because her life “hardly describes the general Black experience”.

At the coming Cop30 summit in Belém, it hopes to gather support so it can launch negotiations for a new treaty next year. The group's founder, Tzeporah Berman, explains why the Amazon rainforest and the global south are an ideal springboard for the movement.\\nWhy will you be campaigning  for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty?\\nWe have to change the way people think about oil, gas and coal, which are responsible for 86% of the carbon dioxide emissions that are trapped in our atmosphere. The world is on track to produce 110% more oil, gas and coal by 2030 than we can ever burn if we want to keep global warming below 2C [above preindustrial levels]. That's because the market is distorted by trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies.\\nAnd it's only getting worse because every country is trying to artificially keep alive their fossil fuel industries, even though they know the damage they cause. At Cop30, we will be working to expand the group of countries participating in the development of the treaty.\\nWhat do you say to those who say a non-proliferation treaty is unfeasible anytime soon?\\nChange starts that way. When we first talked about renewable energy, people literally laughed at us because it was so expensive. But we've seen a tremendous change in technology and in prices so that today we are powering whole countries with renewable energy. Every day, we see major breakthroughs. Last year, one in five cars sold on the planet was electric. We can change very quickly when we want to.\\nYes, the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is a big new idea, but at this moment in history, with floods, fires and heatwaves sweeping the planet, we need big new ideas.\\nWhat progress have you made since the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative was founded?\\nThe push to negotiate a treaty is endorsed by more than 4,000 civil society groups including all of the world's major faith, health, women's and climate organisations. More than 120 cities have passed motions to support the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and they are increasingly being joined by subnational governments such as California. We also now have 101 Nobel laureates and over 3,000 scientists who have endorsed the treaty. This growing movement helps create the political space for more countries to join.\\nSo far 17 countries are participating in the development of the treaty. In addition, 10 countries have been attending senior officials meetings as observers and are showing significant interest and we hope there will be another string of announcements at and before Belém.\\nBut what are the prospects of achieving a critical mass?\\nTreaties for landmines and chemical weapons started with a core group of just 20 to 30 countries who wanted ambitious, binding rules. That shifted the social norm so it became unacceptable to stockpile those weapons even for many nations who were not signatories to those treaties.\\nToday, fossil fuels are our weapons of mass destruction. They kill more people on this planet every year than anything else. Even before we calculate the toll from climate change, air pollution alone kills 8 million people each year. Fossil fuels are the greatest threat to human life.\\nWe expect to have enough countries next year to begin negotiations. Before and during Cop30 we will be hosting major meetings of senior officials and ministers mapping the pathway toward negotiations, including the key convenings and conferences that need to be held in that process in the months ahead and we hope there will be a significant announcement on progress at Belém, so look out.\\nThis goes beyond the traditional left-right divide, doesn't it?\\nFor me, this all started with the conversations I had in Canada with the oil industry over the tar sands in Alberta. The Trudeau government back then would say: “We know we need to reduce emissions and the world is going to get off fossil fuels but our oil is ethical,” even though the tar sands produce some of the heaviest carbon in the world.\\nI later realised that whether you're in Norway or Ecuador or Argentina, it's the same conversation. Every company wants to produce the last barrel sold. So every year we miss our emissions reduction targets and every year we drill for more oil, we frack for more gas and we dig up more coal. And then we wonder why the system isn't changing, even though renewable energy is cheaper.\\nAs long as there is no supply side climate policy, then we are trying to cut with one half of the scissors by solely focusing on reducing demand. This is true even with supposedly progressive climate leaders in office, such as Trudeau in Canada, Biden in the US or Starmer in Britain. The system has been designed in such a way that, domestically, elected officials don't feel responsible for constraining production. That means we are continuing to put our intellectual, financial and political capital towards expanding a system that we say we're phasing out. And it is almost always the case that what we build today will be what we use tomorrow.\\nWhy do you think the Brazilian climate summit is the place to expand this dialogue?\\nIndigenous nations in the heart of the Amazon campaigned to keep fossil fuels in the ground long before anywhere in the global north. It has now spread across the world from Standing Rock and the tar sands in the US to anti-coal campaigns in Australia and Europe.\\nIn the run-up to Belém, we've been working with indigenous nations and associations across the region to promote the idea of a fossil-free Amazon zone so it can be a model for other parts of the world. We have tremendous support from civil society and significant backing from countries. Colombia was the first to endorse a fossil-free Amazon – a commitment to no oil and gas exploration and extraction in the region – and a global fossil fuel treaty, and it is doing diplomatic outreach to other countries.\\nHow do you tackle climate justice issues?\\nFor the last several years, we've been commissioning studies looking at how to apply equity and finance principles to a negotiation on fossil fuel production: who gets to produce and for how long? This takes in historical responsibility, just transition, social justice and levels of fossil fuel dependency.\\nBrazil – the biggest nation in the Amazon region – has just sold more than 100 oil and gas exploration blocks, including some offshore from the rainforest. How do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil and leaders such as Lula to give up on fossil fuels?\\nAt this moment in history, leadership is important. What Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, said when he joined the fossil fuel treaty was that the science is clear: no new fossil fuel expansion fits in a world where we meet our climate targets. The International Energy Agency has said the same and so has the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The international court of justice has now suggested that is not only a scientific finding but a legal obligation.\\nIt's absurd that there's this constant drumbeat of pledges and speeches to protect the Amazon, to support Lula and other leaders in the Amazon while, at the same time, financing new oil drilling in the heart of the rainforest, in the mouth of the river, and then buying that oil. We need responsibility along the entire chain and we need more than press releases and empty pledges. We need support for Lula and other leaders to move forward with protecting the Amazon and stopping drilling.\\nHow do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil to give up on drilling particular fields?\\nWe've formed a finance working group that has experts predominantly from the global south. They're producing a series of papers on trade agreements, tax agreements, debt relief and market access that would provide countries who have joined the fossil fuel treaty with financial support and benefits, as well as looking at specific just transition funds from the private sector available only to countries participating in the development of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.\\nA larger question is whether or not fossil fuel development in the global south can eliminate poverty. The plans for expansion in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa show the fossil fuel industry using these regions as a gas station for the global north: Europe and North America. They are unlikely to provide significant economic revenue or products to the areas that they're exploiting. There's a tremendous amount of evidence from the last 50 years to show the legacy is more likely to be poisoned waterways and expensive spills. This has been the case for countries that have had fossil fuel development for decades such as Ecuador or Nigeria. The ecological devastation dramatically diminishes local communities' abilities to support themselves.\\nNew fossil fuel infrastructure has high costs and leads to ongoing dependency whereas renewable energy infrastructure creates independence and greater long-term health and economic benefits. But less than 2% of global finance for renewables was in the global south. It's great that we have seen a commitment from governments in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to triple renewables, but we need those commitments to be coupled with commitments to decommission existing fossil fuel assets and to ensure money flows into the global south.\\nWon't the likely absence of the US make it difficult to move forward?\\nWe don't expect the US and other major producers to join at this point and that's fine. That means the treaty being developed will be strong and built by those committed to ambitious action commensurate with the science calling for absolute decline of emissions and production.\\nThe far right is already on the offensive against net zero [emissions targets]. Won't the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative give them an even bigger target?\\nPoliticians can talk about the benefits and costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy all they want, but the real benefit for real people is that the sun doesn't send you a bill at the end of the month. When we build renewable energy infrastructure, that means energy is free for life. Make no mistake about it, renewables are not just a different way of powering our cars and our homes; they're about changing power in every sense of the word.\"]"

         "[\"After clinching the title of top conservative podcast in America (and second overall news podcast, according to Apple's ranking) in March, Charlie Kirk said: “We're not just talking. We're activating a revolution.”\\nIn the hours after his killing at age 31 on the first stop of a buzzy college campus tour, the rightwing activist's words echoed through young conservative circles. Social media eulogies rolled in, with users reposting clips of Kirk with his wife and children. Parents of teens wrote on X of learning about Kirk's death through their children. “My 17 year old is bumming. Told me he plays Charlie in the background on his computer when he's on it,” the conservative radio host Jesse Kelly wrote on X. Another X user wrote about speaking to teens at a church youth group: “Everyone I talked to is so distraught and heartbroken at his passing.”\\nA key figure in Donald Trump's success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk's beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.\\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn't agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events. He was like a gen Z and millennial version of Rush Limbaugh – the rightwing, shock-jock commentator who dominated US airwaves in the 1990s – even if his base had no clue who that was.\\nKirk's ideology was caustic; he espoused openly homophobic, racist, sexist, Islamophobic and Christian nationalist views while uplifting misinformation and conspiracy theories. He also campaigned on issues that mattered to young Americans, engaging directly with them – no matter how virulently – on hot-button topics such as abortion, transgender rights, race and Palestinian solidarity.\\nAmy Binder, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University who studies politics and education, describes Kirk's values as “insurgency conservatism” that was “designed to get attention”.\\nIt worked: TikTok users under 30 who voted for Trump in 2024 said they trusted Kirk more than any other individual, according to a New York Times profile, despite the fact that he never held office or a role in the White House. That election saw male voters ages 18 to 29 swing hard to the right; Trump also made inroads with gen Z women. Earlier this year, Trump praised Kirk for “what he's done with the young people”.\\nAs a millennial growing up in the Chicago suburbs, Kirk was obsessed with Limbaugh and the Tea Party movement. His fans also felt like outsiders within the American political system.\\n“After Trump was elected in 2016, I was really surprised to see just how many students who were conservative were no longer identifying with the Republican party or with college Republicans, and had instead pivoted over to being really intrigued with what Turning Point was doing on campus,” Binder said. “They were doing much more exciting programming. It was less electorally focused, less about campaigning, and more about having events that were really confrontational.”\\nKirk appeared equally at ease chumming it up with high-powered donors as he did debating 20-year-olds in sweatpants. Kirk sparred directly with young people through video templates such as “prove me wrong” (a one-on-one debate, where students could wait in line to ask him a question), and he was an early guest on the YouTube series Surrounded, where he sat in a room with 25 liberals and goaded them with statements such as “abortion is murder and should be illegal” and “trans women are not women.”\\nTurning Point USA raked in funding – the New York Times estimated a $92.4m revenue in 2023 – while advancing campus culture wars. Kirk's content brought classic and extreme rightwing ideals to young people's media feeds; he looked like both an old-school, suited conservative in the style of a Fox News host, and a social media-savvy man of the times. His video titles usually bent toward hyperbole (“Charlie Kirk Crushes Woke Lies at Michigan State,” was posted less than a week before the shooting). There were gonzo premises, such as when Kirk and the YouTube prank team Nelk Boys showed up at a Wisconsin frat party to get out the vote in 2024. His meme literacy showed when he handed out hats that read: “White Boy Summer”, a remix of Megan Thee Stallion's “Hot Girl Summer” catchphrase.\\nWith his wife, Erika, owner of a faith-based fashion brand and a former Miss Arizona USA, Kirk softened his image, presenting himself as devoted husband, father and a bit of a lifestyle influencer. He talked to tweens in Maga hats about his preferred Starbucks order and promoted “cuteservatives” like Alex Clark, a Turning Point USA podcaster who branded her show on Maha culture as a rightwing Call Her Daddy. After Kirk's death, Brett Cooper, a 23-year-old conservative influencer in the “womanosphere” with more than 1 million Instagram followers, reposted a video homage that depicted him as a champion for girls and young women. (Yet this was a man who compared abortion to the Holocaust and claimed that women over 30 “aren't attractive in the dating pool”.)\\nFor 10 years, Turning Point USA hosted a “women's summit”, where Kirk and others like Clark and Cooper encouraged attenders to focus on finding husbands. Evie, the conservative women's magazine, published an obituary that called Kirk a “loving father, patriot, and husband”.\\nEven young people who were disgusted by Kirk's rhetoric could not deny his impact. Hasan Piker, the hugely popular leftwing Twitch streamer whose ideology stands in direct contrast to Kirk, was scheduled to debate with Kirk at the end of September at Dartmouth University. Both Piker and the gun control activist David Hogg spoke against political violence in the wake of the shooting (as did many Democratic figures such as Joe Biden, Gavin Newsom and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani). Piker told his followers not to make jokes about Kirk's shooting. “This is a terrifying incident,” Piker said. Hogg called the news “horrifying” on X.\\n“I think it's undeniable to say that Kirk was one of the first and most prominent people to shape what it means to be young and on the right in the US,” said Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of communications at American University who studies extremism.\\nAfter Kirk's death, Braddock said he had seen “individuals calling this an inflection point, or a turning point where the left can no longer be tolerated”. Rightwing pundits have been eager to blame the left for the shooting.\\nAdam Pennings, 25, is the executive director of Run Gen Z, a non-profit that supports young Republican candidates. “He's always just been such an important part” of the young conservative party, Pennings said of Kirk. “He was everywhere.”\\nPennings knew Kirk through his work, but the two were not close. Still, Pennings said, due to Kirk's omnipresence: “I feel like I lost a friend.”\", \"Charlie Kirk's death by a shooter's bullet on a university campus in Utah on Wednesday has left the United States, a country already grappling with mounting political anger and polarization, in a state of profound shock bordering on despair.\\nKirk, a rising star of Donald Trump's make America great again (Maga) movement, was struck in the neck by a single shot as he addressed a large student crowd at Utah Valley University. The event had been billed as the grand opening of his 15-stop “America Comeback Tour”, but instead will be marked as the place where he uttered his last words.\\nThe 31-year-old leader of the rightwing student group Turning Point USA was about 20 minutes into a Q&A, ironically engaging with a question on mass shootings in America, when the shot rang out. Within seconds, hundreds of students had scattered screaming from the campus lawn.\\nWithin minutes of that, gruesome videos began to proliferate through social media, apparently undeterred by any algorithm. They showed Kirk being hit, slumping to his left side and profusely bleeding.\\nLong before Kirk was pronounced dead at 4.40pm – poignantly in a post from his champion, the US president, on Truth Social – the wave of profound shock was breaking over both sides of the US's political divide.\\n“This is horrific. I am stunned,” said the Republican senator from Texas Ted Cruz, who described Kirk on Twitter/X as a “good friend” since the young activist's teenage years.\\nKirk was unashamedly far to the right of the US political spectrum and had expressed openly bigoted views and engaged in homophobic and Islamophobic rhetoric. He recently tweeted: “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.”\\nHe mixed evangelical Christian beliefs with rightwing politics into a combustible brew. During an appearance with Trump in Georgia last fall, he claimed that Democrats “stand for everything God hates”, adding: “This is a Christian state. I'd like to see it stay that way.”\\nBut mourning for Kirk crossed the political aisle.\\nJoe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's Morning Joe who has been unrestrained at times in his criticism of Kirk's political posturing, called the shooting “tragic and sickening”. He added: “Violence targeting political public figures is violence against American democracy itself and the freedom of every American to express their views.”\\nTommy Vietor, a former staffer in Barack Obama's White House, issued an even darker warning. Political violence, he said, was a “cancer that will feed off itself and spread … it will rip this country apart”.\\nThe political violence that Vietor identified is etched into the US's psyche. The country has had to absorb the assassinations of four sitting presidents including Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy, as well as the tragic trilogy of 1960s shootings of Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr.\\nThose grim historic landmarks were brought slamming back into public consciousness by the assassination attempt on Trump at a presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024. Trump survived that incident by a hair's breadth, which he has since claimed to be an act of God's will. A second would-be assassin later waited for Trump on a Florida golf course before being discovered in the nick of time by his security detail.\\nAt the same time America has been rocked by the killing on the streets of Manhattan of a top healthcare executive, and in June an attack in Minnesota saw a gunman brutally shoot a local lawmaker dead in her own home.\\nKirk's death – though the precise motive behind his killing remains so far unknown – leaves the US standing on the edge of a new abyss, over which a black cloud now looms over the safety of its public figures and the sanctity of its public debate.\\n“What the actual hell have we become?” asked the Catholic writer Emily Zanotti, speaking for many. In a comment under her X feed, another poster said: “We have met the enemy, and he is us.”\\nDylan Housman, editor-in-chief of the rightwing news outlet the Daily Caller, also expressed foreboding. “We can't live in a country where things like this happen,” he said.\\nFor months now the temperature of the US's political discourse has been rising. As JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, put it following the Kirk shooting: “Political violence unfortunately has been ratcheting up in this country.”\\nIn June a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota, Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed in a shooting. Federal and state judges have reported a plethora of threats, including deliveries of unsolicited pizzas to their homes in grotesque reference to the 2020 killing of Daniel Anderl, the son of a New Jersey district judge Esther Salas.\\nKirk's killing takes this booming scourge of discourse-by-bullet to another level. The location of the shooting in itself indicates that there might be trouble ahead, as the TV political journalist Chuck Todd noted. “On a college campus, no less, a place where we should be celebrating speech, not trying to silence it.”\\nThe identity of the victim, too, raises the stakes dramatically. Kirk was the golden boy of the Maga movement, a Trump favorite.\\nThe president called Kirk “legendary” in his post announcing the death. The Turning Point leader was boosted to nationwide prominence when he was taken on as personal aide to Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\\nKirk's ascent within the Maga firmament was as fiery as the trademark pyrotechnical displays that opened his Turning Point “people's conventions”. The speakers he attracted on stage were like a roll-call of Maga royalty – JD Vance, former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, entrepreneur and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and many more.\\nBy Wednesday night consternation had already begun to be aired about how the Trump administration, and the wider Maga movement, would respond to the loss of one of their dearly beloved own. “There are people who are fomenting [political violence] in this country,” Pritzker said. “The president's rhetoric often foments it.”\\nLater this month, Kirk had a stop on his Comeback Tour scheduled at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. On 25 September he was scheduled to debate the progressive influencer, Hasan Piker.\\nAfter Kirk's shooting, Piker spoke out about his fears on his live stream. “This is a terrifying incident,” he said. “The reverberation of people seeking out vengeance in the aftermath of this violent, abhorrent incident is going to be genuinely worrisome.”\", \"Charlie Kirk, the founder of the powerful rightwing youth activist group Turning Point USA (TPUSA) and a close ally of Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday afternoon while speaking at a university campus event in Utah. \\nHis death shocked the nation as members of both political parties expressed outrage at the killing. Spencer Cox, the Utah governor, called the shooting a “political assassination”, though a motive is not yet known and the shooter remained at large on Wednesday night. \\n“This is a dark day for our state. It's a tragic day for our nation,” Cox, a Republican, said at a press conference, appealing for an end to the political violence that has stalked the country in recent months.\\nKirk was killed while speaking on the campus of Utah Valley University (UVU), near Salt Lake City, as part of the American Comeback Tour, which is hosted by the university's Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter and was attended by as many as 3,000 people, according to Jeffrey Long, the police chief at the university.\\nDetails about the shooter's identity and motive are still unknown, but state authorities said they believed the incident was a “targeted attack”. Kirk was about 20 minutes into a presentation when a single shot was fired at him, the university said.\\nTrump announced Kirk's death in a social media post, and ordered all American flags to be lowered to half-staff in honor of the 31-year-old conservative youth leader. “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,” Trump wrote, adding: “He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.”\\nThe president, along with other prominent conservatives, was also quick to fan the flames of division by blaming the “radical left political violence” for Kirk's killing. In a speech in the Oval Office, Trump called Kirk the “best of America”, and listed acts of violence that he attributed to the left while omitting violence against Democrats, such as the killing of a Minnesota state lawmaker.\\n“For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today and it must stop right now,” Trump said in his speech.\\nThrough the day, two suspects were separately taken into custody but ultimately released. One person detained at the scene, George Zinn, was deemed not to be a suspect but was charged with obstructing justice. A second person taken into custody was released after being interviewed. Neither had ties to the shooting, according to the university.\\nBystander footage of the shooting and its aftermath captured a chaotic scene. In videos circulating on social media, Kirk can be seen being struck in the neck by a bullet while speaking beneath a tent in the UVU courtyard in Orem, Utah. Video footage also shows students scrambling to run from the sound of gunfire. Kirk was transported to a nearby hospital, where he died, authorities said.\\nLocal and campus police, the FBI and the Utah department of public safety are investigating the incident.\\nBeau Mason, the commissioner of Utah's department of public safety, said investigators were reviewing security camera images of the suspect, who wore dark clothing and possibly fired “a longer-distance shot” from a roof.\\nLaw enforcement officials briefly took two people into custody before releasing them. One person was detained at the scene but deemed not to be a suspect, and the second person was released after being interviewed by police. Neither of the individuals had ties to the shooting, authorities said.\\nAt the press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Cox pledged that authorities would find the shooter and hold them “accountable to the furthest extent of the law”.\\n“And I just want to remind people that we still have the death penalty here in the state of Utah,” Cox said.\\nIn an internal email to staff members posted online on Wednesday, Justin Streiff, Turning Point USA COO, said: “It is with a heavy heart that we, the Turning Point USA leadership team, write to notify you that earlier this afternoon Charlie went to his eternal reward with Jesus Christ in Heaven … However, in the meantime, Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action will be closed for business until Monday, the 15th – likely longer.”\\nUVU announced that it would be closed for the remainder of the week and classes and other events would be suspended until Monday. In a statement, the university president said the campus was “shocked and saddened” by the violence and offered condolences to Kirk's family.\\n“We grieve with our students, faculty, and staff who bore witness to this unspeakable tragedy,” Astrid Tuminez said. “We firmly believe that UVU is a place to share ideas and to debate openly and respectfully. Any attempt to infringe on those rights has no place here. We do not condone any form of violence at UVU and seek to make our campus a safe place for all.”\\nEyewitnesses said Kirk was being questioned about mass shootings when he was shot in the neck.\\nA Deseret News reporter, Emma Pitts, who was at the event, said that Kirk was on his second question and that it was “regarding mass shootings”.\\n“The person he was debating had asked about if he knew how many mass shootings had involved a transgender shooter, to which Kirk responded,” Pitts said. “[Then] he asked how many mass shootings had [there] been in the last couple of years” and “before he could even answer, we heard a gunshot and we just saw Charlie Kirk's neck turn to the side and it appeared that he had been shot in the neck”.\\n“There was blood, immediately a lot of blood,” Pitts said. “After the shots were fired, everyone immediately took to the ground … we were just trying to stay hidden.”\\nThen, Pitts said, “everyone started running away”.\\nThe shooting drew condemnation from both sides of the political spectrum.\\n“Political violence has no place in America,” said Kamala Harris in a statement. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, expressed a similar sentiment: “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.”\\nMike Lee, a Utah senator, wrote: “Charlie Kirk was an American patriot … This murder was a cowardly act of violence, an attack on champions of freedom like Charlie, the students who gathered for civil debate, and all Americans who peacefully strive to save our nation. The terrorists will not win. Charlie will. Please join me in praying for his wife Erika and their children. May justice be swift.”\\nSam Levin contributed reporting\"]"

         "[\"On an overcast Tuesday in July, divers Mitch Johnson and Sean Taylor shimmy into their wetsuits on the back of the R/V Xenarcha, a 28ft boat floating off the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes, south of Los Angeles. Behind them, the clear waters of the Pacific are dotted with a forest of army-green strands, waving like mermaid hair underwater.\\nWe are here to survey the giant Pacific kelp, a species that once thrived in these ice cold waters. But over the past two decades, a combination of warm ocean temperatures, pollution, overfishing and the proliferation of hungry sea urchins that devour the kelp has led to an 80% decline in the forest along the southern California coast.\\nIn recent years, scientists have staged a comeback – mounting one of the largest and most successful kelp restoration projects in the world. To do so, they've recruited an army of hammer-wielding divers to smash and clean up the voracious urchins. Today's trip is a chance to see that success up close.\\nSeen from the boat's edge, the kelp fronds are so thick and sturdy at places that they form mats at the ocean's surface, sturdy enough for egrets and herons to perch on while they poked at the fish beneath. These waters host a multitude of species, from bright orange garibaldi fish and white sharks that silently cruise the coastline to blue whales which sail through the deep channel a few miles to our east.\\nDivers like Johnson and Taylor have a variety of tools at their disposal. Some days, they pick up rock hammers – like an underwater version of the seven dwarves – and dive to crack open the ravenous purple urchins that destroy the baby kelp. But today, they are armed only with a tape and a camera to survey the status of this gigantic concealed forest.\\nGear on, the divers give a thumbs-up to Tom Ford, chief executive officer of the Bay Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to restoring Santa Monica Bay and its coastal waters, who is piloting the boat. With a small splash, they disappear into the water. Ford and I wait, with the quiet slapping of waves on the side of the Xenarcha, to see what they find.\\nLed by the Bay Foundation, divers in the Santa Monica Bay have spent 15,575 hours underwater over the past 13 years. To bring the kelp back, they focus on minimizing the impact of one voracious eater: the purple urchin. The effort has been successful, smashing 5.8 million purple urchins and clearing 80.7 acres (32.7 hectares, the size of 61 football fields), and allowing the kelp to return.\\nBut with the results contained far offshore and underwater, has anyone noticed? Ford wonders the same thing. “We call it the forgotten forest,” he says.\\nThe fast-growing kelp ecosystems are known as the “sequoias of the sea” for good reason: they store large amounts of carbon, create habitat for more than 800 marine species and blunt the powerful force of storm waves. Technically, they are a macro-algae, and can grow as much as 2ft each day, reaching 100ft from reef bed to surface.\\nFor those lucky enough to see the kelp from under the waves, it can feel like a fairytale – a forest, but instead of walking through it, you're flying underwater.\\nFord still remembers the first time he dived into the forest as a scuba diver. The sunlight looked like tongues of flame rippling through the blades from underwater, and the shafts of light peeked through the small holes in the canopy. “It looked like a cathedral, with light shooting through the stained glass,” he says. “And sometimes you float down through this and there's thousands of fish of all sorts of colors just flitting around everywhere. It's like flying through an unimaginably dense forest of life.”\\nBut for a time, these glorious environments were at risk of disappearing. When the Bay Foundation started working in these waters in 2012, the sea bed looked like carpets of purple – blanketed in endemic golf ball-sized spiky urchins.\\nIt was a symptom of an ecosystem gone haywire, with multiple overlapping injuries: sea otters, which eat urchins as a staple of their diet, were almost wiped out by hunters in the 19th century. Then, from the 1940s to the 1970s, a large amount of DDT was discharged from a chemical plant into the sea off Palos Verdes. Sediment from landslides also buried the reefs in silt, preventing anything from growing. More recently, the local sea stars, which eat the urchins, were hit with a wasting disease, and turned to goo. All that was left was urchins, which eat kelp at an incredible rate, and scratched the reef bed so much that any kelp spores still circulating couldn't grab a foothold.\\nFord and the Bay Foundation did multiple tests to determine the optimal amount of urchins per square meter: two. Meanwhile, some areas of the barrens had 70-80 urchins per meter. Since they didn't have much to eat, they were basically empty zombie urchins – hungry, empty of their meat, just hanging on and preventing kelp from growing. There was a lot to do.\\nThe Bay Foundation applied for grants from the state and federal authorities and started hiring divers, gathering 75 volunteers, and even working with commercial fishers to help out. Ford points out that the team was not smashing the healthy urchins that people depend on for their livelihood. “We were paying the fishermen to put back the forest, and then they could then go back in and fish from there again,” he says.\\nThat's the case with Terry Herzik, a longtime red sea urchin fisher, who started working with the foundation in 2012, spending nine hours a day smashing urchins instead of collecting them for sale. “No one has more hours down there clearing urchins than Terry,” says Ford, gesturing to Herzik's boat, the Sun Spot, which is anchored nearby. “We could not have achieved this without him.”\\nSlowly, methodically, divers ventured down out and smashed urchins week after week, clearing the plots. Hitting an urchin with a foot-long rock hammer gives “a satisfying crunch”, Johnson says. He is quick to point out that this is manual labor, just underwater (and while wearing a cumbersome scuba suit).\\nThe divers talk about their job almost as if they are part of a construction crew – it's repetitive work, but fulfilling, like filling potholes in the ocean. “You just tap, tap, and sometimes you have to reach into crevices to get the urchins out,” says Taylor. “Your forearms get super tired.”\\nBut the real benefit is seeing how quickly the kelp returns when the urchins are under control – in some cases within a matter of months. That's because the microscopic single-celled kelp spores are wafting in the water column all the time – much like seeds of a plant carried by the wind – waiting for the right conditions to attach to the reef and start growing.\\nJohnson remembers one spot along the coast that he worked on. “Within three months, the kelp came back,” he says. “I've never seen a kelp forest that dense – and it was insane to see how quickly it returned.”\\nTaylor and Johnson, who both work for the Bay Foundation, resurface and haul themselves on to the back of the boat. Shaking the sea water out of their hair, they describe what they saw in the survey area: tons of fish, a small shark and a forest of green.\\n“There's still a lot of kelp,” Johnson tells Ford, but it's not all good news. “There's still a pocket where the urchins are expanding out.” It's still a mystery why some areas stay restored with kelp, while others return to barrens.\\nThe boat moves on to another point on the coast, where the divers descend again. Here, the kelp forest is so thick that it forms a mat keeping the boat in place.\\n“I don't know if we need to anchor,” Ford says. “I'll just let the algae hold me.”\\nFord and I lift up a kelp frond from the edge of the boat. It's slippery, rubbery and slightly slimy. On the top, I can see a colony of bryozoans – tiny filter-feeding invertebrates that live on the surface of the kelp. Teensy shrimp and snails also gather on the fronds: evidence of its importance as a habitat for so many creatures. I run my fingers along the blades that are just starting to differentiate and grow the bulbs that keep the structure afloat. Even as a parent to fast-growing children, it's hard to imagine the speed at which this algae moves – always upward, always out. “Everything flows from the kelp.” Ford says.\\nThe project could be a model for other parts of the world where kelp is struggling. In Tasmania and South Korea, efforts are under way to save kelp. California's Santa Barbara channel is also a target for future restoration work.\\nWith blobs of warmer oceans in a climate-changed future, kelp may still be at risk – but there are hopeful signs. The sites that have been restored remain mostly intact. The foundation's research shows that California spiny lobster have returned to the area, and fish such as kelp bass and sheepshead are more abundant now than before restoration work started. The kelp also improves water quality, absorbing excess nutrients, and keeps sediments in place in a similar way that trees hold the land from sliding after rains. And the improvements even benefited the valuable red sea urchins – in sites where the kelp has been restored, red sea urchin gonads (the prized parts, also known as uni) weigh 168% more.\\nWhile the effect of the urchins has been devastating, Ford points out that kelp has always faced challenges: from powerful waves that rip out the strands from the seabed, to summertime temperatures that kill off the nutrients needed to grow. That has made the kelp super-resilient – and ready to pounce at any opportunity to regrow. “Part of the reason why we see such a rapid response to the restoration is because the system has evolved to respond rapidly to beneficial conditions,” he says.\\nPerhaps the kelp will have a fairytale future after all – one that helps the planet, the people and the coastline into the next century.\", \"Rodd Kelsey gazed out on the golden slopes of Point Reyes national seashore sweeping down to the rugged California coastline, pointing to the patches laden with invasive stalks of prickly thistle and browning sod. These are some of the hallmarks of the region's recent history, he said – but they also showcase the opportunities for its future.\\nA new chapter is unfolding on the striking landscape located some 70 miles (113km) north of San Francisco. The unique patchwork of wild and pastoral ranges operated by the National Park Service (NPS) has spent decades mired in battles between local ranchers operating on the lands and environmentalists who see their presence as a blight.\\nAs part of a settlement reached early this year, 12 organic dairies and cattle operations agreed to take a multimillion-dollar buyout – the financial details of which have been largely kept secret – and were given 15 months to move off the land.\\nThe deal opened more than 16,000 acres (6,475 hectares) for conservation, left in the hands of the Nature Conservancy, the international conservation non-profit that financed and mediated the agreement. As the group's California land program director, Kelsey is among those shepherding the enormous, five-year restoration effort.\\nLast week, California legislators awarded $2.7m in state funding to the plan, out of a $10m fund set aside for Point Reyes's restoration.\\nBut eight months after the settlement was signed, tensions are still raw in the picturesque communities tucked against the seashore.\\nConcerns about how California will replace the lost supply of organic dairy linger as multigenerational ranchers wind down more than a century of work. There are questions about the way the deal was brokered, and whether the Nature Conservancy's plans will meet the critical environmental challenges that are only intensifying as the world warms.\\nIt's a future laced with both hope and heartbreak. But after what Kelsey called “a very painful transition”, he's eager to focus on what lies ahead.\\nPoint Reyes is still considered a biodiversity hotspot – one of 25 regions on earth most abundant with life with “the threat of loss most severe”, according to the NPS. From coastal sand dunes to tree-covered ridges, its dynamic terrain is a refuge for rare plants and animals, including more than 50 plants and 50 animals listed as threatened or endangered.\\nThe landscapes have also undergone considerable change due to human disruption. There are more than 300 species of aggressive, non-native plants spreading in Point Reyes, roughly 10% of which are a direct threat to ecosystems.\\nBut buried beneath a blanket of weeds lie layers of native seeds waiting for the chance to be resown. The goal – to create a resilient mosaic of vegetation and terrain that helps biodiversity thrive – depends on the right plants having space to reach for the sun.\\nTo help them, Kelsey and a team of partners are planning to rely on what was once considered an environmental adversary: cows.\\nWith a coalition of scientists, conservationists, tribal members and the NPS, the Nature Conservancy has begun outlining a restoration proposal where new herds will be brought in not for milk, but for targeted grazing – a crucial tool, they say, for removing invasive plants and making space for native ones to regrow.\\nSome spots will require heavy intervention. Others, a lighter touch. The team will also use mowing and prescribed burning to eradicate what the cows can't chomp. The idea is ambitious, but it's also been tested. The Nature Conservancy already manages roughly 400,000 former ranch lands across California and is incorporating research done at its other properties where coastal grasslands have been restored.\\nThe stakes are high: if successful, this living laboratory could inform conservation efforts around the world and provide insights into how to sustain native ecosystems alongside livestock. What's learned here could help this region and others soften the blow as the climate crisis unfolds.\\n“Three to four years from now, we will have learned a lot and we will be charting a course for the future,” Kelsey said. “That's part of the experiment here.”\\nIt's a controversial approach with a set of steep challenges, but Kelsey is confident.\\n“Remarkably, these native plants that have mostly disappeared from coastal ecosystems just start popping back up,” he added. “It's latent and sitting in there, waiting to respond.”\\nOn a warm August morning, sunshine pierced the fog that shrouds the seashore even in summer. Clusters of cows could be seen dotting the hillsides, the smell of manure hanging heavy on the salted ocean breeze. Nearby, a herd of tule elk, endemic to this region of California, gathered on the horizon, a large bull at the center bugling loudly to the delight of tourists battling the gusty winds to catch a glimpse.\\nThis corner of west Marin county has long been a popular destination for nature lovers and foodies alike. Millions of visitors come each year for its wild beaches and trails with sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean, as well as the organic produce, dairy and cheese. After the national seashore was designated in 1962 with a unique deal that secured dairies' ties to their historic lands within the park, agriculture, nature and recreation coexisted, forming the fabric of the region.\\nBut the bucolic scenes masked the battles brewing in the local communities over the beloved area that was also imperiled by intensive land use and the extreme conditions wreaked by the climate crisis.\\n“A lot of the non-native grasses were introduced because they were good for forage or brought inadvertently,” Kelsey said of the plants now blanketing the hillsides. Manure spread over the pastures over the years changed the soils and encouraged their spread, while extensive water use drained moisture from already parched systems.\\nFights also ignited over fencing put up by the ranches that limited the range of wildlife, including the tule elk. When California's recent drought desiccated the region and left scores of animals cut off from water sources, the situation sparked fierce local protests.\\nNext year, many of the fences will come down. Instead, conservationists will rely on “virtual” fencing to more precisely manage grazing cows, an “emerging technology”, Kelsey said, that uses a GPS signal programmed to a collar and has been tested on the Nature Conservancy's 14,000-acre (5,665-hectare) preserve to the south in San Luis Obispo county.\\n“It is really going to be a gamechanger in managing cows carefully but opening up the landscape for things like elk so they can move around more freely,” he said.\\nThe Nature Conservancy will work closely with local stakeholders and stewards, including the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria and the NPS, who both declined to speak to the Guardian for this story.\\nWhile early phases of the plan are focused on invasive plant removal, groups of researchers are already preparing for step two: planting the prairies with a mix of natives that will encourage resilience and diversity.\\n“It's kind of like the ocean,” Donna Faure, executive director of the Point Reyes National Seashore Association (PRNSA), said, walking through a sea of swaying yellow grasses. “It all looks kind of the same but it's different underneath.” The PRNSA has worked closely with the NPS, and funded the first phase of native seed research being used to inform restoration plans.\\nThe need feels urgent: California's native grasslands have been decimated, with less than 1% remaining. Northern coastal prairie, considered one of the most diverse grasslands – and home to close to a third of the state's threatened and endangered species – still grows wild in Point Reyes, and the PRNSA is working quickly to expand it.\\nHelping native plants thrive has a documented impact on other species. Plant communities support a range of insect populations that other creatures, including birds, feed on. The work will be done in close coordination with local communities, rooted in research and science with room to adjust based on monitored successes, according to Faure and Kelsey.\\n“Having a diverse mosaic sets the table for the whole cascading effects in the system,” Kelsey said. “It literally translates to more baby birds because there's more food.”\\nAs conservationists excitedly step into their new roles as stewards, others are lamenting what will be lost as part of Point Reyes's new direction. The ranches now being dissembled were some of the few remaining producers of organic dairy in the region.\\n“Everything I have worked for is being threatened,” said Albert Straus, the founder of Straus Family Creamery, the first certified organic creamery in the US. He dedicated his life to securing and supporting sustainability-focused dairy operations and is working to secure carbon neutrality in his business and the 13 farms supplying it by 2030. \\nThe settlement won't mean the end of his business, but it will create more challenges for the creamery, said Straus, since many of his organic suppliers are now leaving the area and finding new ones will be tough.\\nStraus sees the settlement as the final straw following years of hardship, inflicted by perennial legal challenges, and the broader struggles of 21st-century dairy farming – another disastrous step toward a future that favors factory farms. Many of the milk cows that once graced the picturesque hillsides in Point Reyes have been sold for slaughter or to large-scale dairies far less dedicated to animal welfare and limiting their environmental footprint.\\n“There are ways of working to show local food production is really an asset and a benefit to society and to the community,” he said. “In a climate where we are importing a lot of our food, we are at risk.”\\nHe feels that the agriculture industry and the community more broadly has been betrayed by the NPS, which was able to acquire the lands in the 1960s under an agreement that ranches would be able to remain there. He said the dairies opted in to the voluntary buyouts under duress, exhausted from years of legal defense and the inability to thrive financially or invest long-term into upgrading infrastructure. Straus has also been a strong advocate for the ranch workers displaced by the shutdown of the dairies, many of whom lived on the lands where they worked.\\nHis concerns echo those of the wider dairy industry. Farmers are dealing with the climate crisis, drought, economic pressure and more. Young people are leaving the business or being deterred by the obstacles of getting started.\\n“We went from 4.6m dairy farms in the US in 1940 to about 24,000 today,” Straus said. “The average age of farmers is 60 years old. We don't have a future generation.”\\nStraus is not giving up. He is working to pull together community resources that he hopes will revitalize area farms.\\nBut even as some lawsuits over the settlement remain and the Republican-led House committee on natural resources has launched an investigation into how the agreement came about, most of the dairy operations have begun to move on.\\n“Our family, and our neighbors' families, have loved and cared for this land for generations, and it has been a very difficult decision to leave,” said ranchers Kevin and Nancy Lunny in a statement issued with the settlement announcement. “While this transition will be painful, we believe it's ultimately what is best for our family, given the difficult circumstances.”\\nThe last of the ranches is expected to clear its cows by the end of September.\\n“Even though we have lost these dairies, I am hoping we can rebuild in the future,” Straus said. He's garnered the interest of the Department of the Interior, which he says is looking at solutions that will help them move forward.\\nLily Verdone, who heads the Marin Agricultural Land Trust, an organization working to secure the county's agricultural legacy and support local farmers and ranchers, acknowledged how challenging the changes in Point Reyes have been to the community, but said they are also ready for a change.\\n“It feels very heavy because it's been such a buildup over time and such a struggle,” she said. But the obstacles extend far past the seashore. From economic pressures to environmental ones, it's been increasingly challenging to make ends meet.\\n“Agriculture, and especially dairies, have been losing ground in the region – across the country – for a long time,” she added. “We have to look at the future and say: how can we invest back in?”\\nThe settlement didn't secure a full eradication of agriculture from the park. The NPS is negotiating long-term leases for two ranching operations within Point Reyes. Nine others are spread across the national seashore and its sister park, the Golden Gate national recreation area.\\nSome environmentalist groups remain skeptical of the cows' continued presence on the lands. But as both sides adapt to an uneasy truce, all eyes are on the project and whether it will make good on its promises. \\n“This is a problem a century in the making. None of this is going to happen super fast,” Kelsey said, adding that it won't be possible to take the landscapes back to where they were centuries ago, before humans more deeply intervened. Something new is being created.\\nAnd healing Point Reyes means more than just healing the land – it's also about healing the community's divisions left over by the years-long battles.\\n“The whole reason there's such a fight over this landscape is because people care deeply about this place,” Kelsey said. “We want to set the table but there's a point in the future where [the Nature Conservancy] steps back and the community is doing the good work for the decades to come.”\\nThey will need local support and dedication to see it through.\\n“What makes a resilient landscape? It's the people who care,” said Tom Gardali, CEO of Audubon Canyon Ranch, one of the partners working with the Nature Conservancy. “It is going to take a community to care for this land, not just in terms of a near-term restoration, but for the long term.”\", \"The morning begins with a sense of anticipation – the calm before 1,200lbs of explosives detonate a stream culvert buried 10ft in Alaska's Tongass national forest.\\nJamie Daniels, 53, and his crew of Tlingit forestry workers take cover in a glade of alders.\\nA few minutes earlier, together with the US Forest Service and a Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition (SAWC) watershed scientist, they fed high-grade explosives into the galvanized steel culvert on a 40ft sled made of spruce trees. The goal now is to vaporize it, along with the rocks on top.\\nCrouched 1,000ft away from the blast site, Jack Greenhalgh, the US Forest Service master blaster veteran, shouts: “Fire in the hole!”\\nHe presses a remote detonator. Seconds later, four 50lb bags of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (Anfo) go off.\\nA boom echoes across the valley, and the air goes liquid as a shockwave sweeps over the group, causing workers to grip hard hats. Football-sized splinters of granite shoot into the sky. Leaves flutter to the ground. A cloud of acrid smoke blows over.\\n“Stand by until we clear the area,” Greenhalgh mumbles, climbing out from behind his berm to inspect the damage – or success, depending on how one looks at it.\\nThe area where the group works is called Cube Cove, a 22,000-acre (8,900-hectare) addition to the 1m-acre Kootznoowoo wilderness on Admiralty Island, where the Tlingit people have lived, hunted and fished for at least 10,000 years. The wilderness makes up a chunk of the 17m-acre Tongass – by far the largest national forest in the United States.\\nThe Tlingit have long considered Admiralty Island, or Kootznoowoo, as sacred ground – a place of spiritual significance, ancestral knowledge and connection to a traditional subsistence lifestyle. Chartreuse-colored leaves of the spiny devil's club, mustard-colored seaweed on the rocks and citrus-scented spruce tips create a distinct rainforest aroma.\\nKootznoowoo means “fortress of the bear”, a fitting name for a landscape home to the highest density of brown bears in North America. The landscape carries the marks of centuries of stewardship – from strips of yellow cedar used for ceremonial baskets to totem poles reflecting intricate clan histories. Eagles soar high above, chalky heads on pivot as they watch for herring or juvenile salmon.\\nThis morning, Daniels wears a bright orange safety helmet, his hands calloused from carving a 12in (30cm) block of Sitka spruce into a brown bear's head. He lives in Angoon, 15 miles (24km) south of Cube Cove along the coast of the island, population 341. His clan house is shd'een hit, the Steel house, and he comes from Deisheetaan Naahaachuneidii, the original Raven Beaver clan of the Edge of the Nation people.\\nDaniels emerges onto the old logging road, and gestures across the valley. “All of this, it's not just land to us. It's our ancestors' land. We're here doing more than just fixing roads or removing culverts – we're reconnecting with our history, our identity and our future. Every culvert we remove, that's a promise to our children that the land will heal.”\\nIn the 1970s, Daniels's relatives along with others from Angoon fought to protect the island from clearcutting, holding bake sales, bingo games and raffles to fund trips to Washington DC. In 1978, elders met with Jimmy Carter. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) formalized protections for the Kootznoowoo wilderness, now part of the Admiralty Island national monument.\\nHowever, that designation came with an asterisk: the sale of 22,890 acres of ancestral Tlingit hunting and fishing grounds to the Shee Atiká Corporation, one of the 13 Native corporations created during the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971.\\nOver the next three decades, more than 80% of that land was clearcut. Culverts, like the one the team is blowing up today, were inserted, blocking the passage of baby salmon upriver.\\nIn 2020, the forest service purchased the Cube Cove land from Shee Atiká for $18m. The agency, alongside Kootznoowoo Inc, the Indigenous corporation based in Angoon, and SAWC, embarked on a five-year project to restore ecological functions, reconnect streams and support the traditional practices of the Tlingit people. The addition of Cube Cove signified the largest transfer of land into formal wilderness designation in the forest service's history.\\n“The purchase of this land opened a door,” Daniels reflects. “It gave us the chance to reconnect with these lands in a way that honors our ancestors and what they knew – how to live in harmony with nature, not dominate it.”\\nWhen he was growing up in Angoon, Daniels recalls, his uncles and cousins talked about hunting and fishing in the area before the clearcutting.\\n“My grandmother spoke of a ‘small sockeye run' from here. I always thought she was talking about just a few fish. But actually, it's thousands of fish – just kokanee salmon, which look like small sockeye.”\\nSince 2022, Daniels and his crew – including his 24-year-old son Justin; 33-year-old Roger Williams; and 41-year-old Walt Washington – have been working to undo decades of damage.\\n“We're trying to get this forest back on its feet,” Daniels explains. “But it's not just the trees. We're restoring the entire ecosystem: the fish, the wildlife and the cultural traditions connected to this land.”\\nFollowing the all-clear from Greenhalgh, SAWC watershed scientist Kelsey Dean slings a forest service Pulaski – part ax and part adze – over her shoulder and follows the old logging road to the blast site. She describes dense thickets of spruce as “dog hair trees” where deer can't forage, and bears can't hunt deer.\\nThis six-day hitch we're participating in is just the second blasting session in a much larger effort. At the end of five years, the team will have removed 80 of the 89 culverts left by loggers, and three bridges, Dean says.\\n“We're restoring habitat, improving hydrologic function and strengthening the land's resilience. After that, it's hands off,” she says, releasing the Pulaski to underline the point.\\nUp ahead, a reddish-brown haze settles over the blast site. The crew gathers along the banks and stares into a triangular trench where the culvert once ran.\\nSean Rielly, a former wilderness ranger and forest service recreation specialist, slaloms down the mud and begins removing shards of the shattered culvert. Daniels and his crew follow, pushing boulders out of the new streambed. Suddenly, the goop of mud and alder leaves releases, flooding downhill. After an hour of work, a small mountain stream flows freely.\\n“Now,” Dean says, “we watch for fish.”\\nThe fish are anadromous, she explains – a fancy word that means being born in freshwater, living in saltwater, then returning to freshwater to lay and fertilize eggs. Their decaying bodies provide food for the carnivorous spruce, hemlock and cedar trees in a healthy stand of old growth. The salmon also sustain the brown bears prowling the island, their coats glossy with salmon oil, their humps shifting as they patrol the rivers, waiting for the salmon to arrive.\\nThe Cube Cove project reaches its midpoint at a moment when the Trump administration renews logging efforts in the Tongass. In June, the US Department of Agriculture announced plans to remove the Roadless Rule protections, exposing 7m acres of the Tongass to extensive clearcuts. Ecologists warn that cutting much of the old growth could release massive amounts of carbon stored in the trees.\\nIn fact, Dean says, when federal funding dried up, Cube Cove progress stalled. Luckily, SAWC was able to use wetlands mitigation money from the state of Alaska to account for the shortfall.\\n“It's unfortunate, what's happening. The region is just now starting to recover from the violence of clearcutting,” says Rob Cadmus, director of SAWC. “At Cube Cove, what we're doing essentially is cleaning up the mess left from logging. Going back to those timber bonanza days would be unconscionable, from an economic, environmental and psychic standpoint.”\\nFederal subsidies have long made old-growth logging in the Tongass artificially profitable. By selling timber below market value and covering high costs like road building and transportation, the government incentivizes larger logging companies from the lower 48 to cut down trees, despite the fact that south-east Alaska's economy is shifting toward eco-tourism and fishing – industries that depend on preserving the Tongass intact, rather than transforming the mountains into a moonscape, with no habitat left for salmon to spawn.\\nAs the crew works with hand tools, Dean inspects the flow of water, while Greenhalgh examines the composition of dirt. The two assess whether a second “cleanup shot” of explosives might be necessary before abandoning the site. Hand tools can take care of the rest, they decide.\\nAs the sun sets over the mouth of the valley, the group begins a 3.5-mile hike along the logging road back to the ATVs and forest service truck. Along the way, Daniels nods toward an alternating series of oven-mitt-shaped prints in the ground – evidence of the island's apex predators.\\n“Bear have survived here for thousands of years,” he says. “And so have we. All of that makes what's happening today feel really personal.”\\nRielly catches up and talks about all the time he spent behind a desk justifying the need for mechanized equipment and explosives and the minimum tool necessary to help the region's recovery. In 2024, a youth group from Angoon removed a culvert barely beneath the ground using only standard forest service hand tools: Pulaskis, shovels, mattocks and rakes.\\nThe effort took seven days.\\n“If we don't do this work, the land will continue to degrade. Culverts clog, landslides are triggered, watersheds are blocked,” Rielly says. “This is the only way to get the job done quickly, especially in such remote terrain.”\\nThrough the scrim of spruce saplings, stumps of ancient old-growth loom: cedar, hemlock and spruce recorded at more than 1,000 years old. The group crosses the Ward Creek bridge, held in place by steel girders 8ft wide covered by creosote timbers. These will be removed at the end of the project, when the crew erases their footprints. On the other side of the bridge, Daniels, Washington and Williams hop on the ATVs, while the rest of the group pile into the truck for the 12-mile trip back to camp.\\nAfter showers in the ocean, the group congregates around a driftwood bonfire on the beach, where thousands of logs were once dumped and rafted together, on the way to the mill. Dean sips from a can of lime sparkling water – a treat in the remote area. Dressed now in flannel pajamas, Washington perches on a rock. He describes his work in the forest as engaging in a cycle of “destruction and renewal”.\\n“The land will heal itself if left alone,” he says. “But sometimes you have to set a bone before it can heal properly. I know that this hard work we're doing out here is for my children, and for their children down the line.”\\n“What you're seeing here is a version of the next generation of conservation – partnerships that connect people, place and purpose,” Cadmus of SAWC says. “When we're out here working side by side, we build a bond that's stronger than words. At the end of the day, that's what heals us. We're all in service to the land.”\\n• This article was amended on 18 August 2025 because an earlier version described anadromous fish as those that spawn and then die.

         "[\"The French prime minister, François Bayrou, has surprised France by calling a sudden confidence vote on 8 September, saying he needs backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.\\nBayrou is almost certain to lose the gamble. All opposition parties from the far right to the left have said they will vote to topple the prime minister and his minority government after only nine months in office.\\nThis would create a fresh political crisis. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, would have to decide whether to swiftly choose a replacement prime minister, while any new appointee could face the same difficulties as Bayrou in securing support.\\nMacron could instead call a snap parliamentary election, but he recently said he was reluctant to do so. Last year's snap election resulted in a divided parliament where no political grouping has an outright majority.\\nBayrou, a centrist and long-term Macron ally, was struggling to get support for his unpopular plan for a €44bn budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France's public debt. His proposals, including scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, were contested across the political class.\\nBayrou knew he was facing a difficult autumn: he would have to force through the 2026 budget without a parliament vote and was likely to be toppled by a no-confidence motion in the coming months. Calling his own confidence vote on 8 September was a way of jumping before he was pushed. He is the least popular prime minister since 1958, with one poll this summer showing 80% of French people did not trust him. \\nBayrou was also braced for anti-government demonstrations and strikes on 10 September against his budget plans, which officials feared might grow to resemble the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protest movement of 2018 and 2019. \\nIf Bayrou falls, the most likely scenario is Macron chooses another prime minister. But it is not certain who, and they may have the same difficulties as Bayrou and struggle to pass a 2026 budget. \\nOne year ago, Macron appointed the rightwing Michel Barnier as prime minister, but parliament ousted him only three months later over budget disagreements. His replacement, Bayrou, will have lasted nine months by the time of the vote.\\nSince Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance won the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron's centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre. \\nThe Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said this week that Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. But the rightwing party Les Républicains, which has propped up the current government, would oppose that.\\nNames that have previously circulated as potential prime ministers include the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was on the right before joining Macron's centrists, and the former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\\nMacron gambled on a snap parliamentary election last summer in an attempt to head off the far right and bolster his authority, but the move backfired and parliament was left deadlocked. Macron told Paris Match earlier this month that he did not intend to hold another snap election.\\nThe justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said this week that a snap election could not be ruled out. Some members of Macron's centrist camp believe calling a parliamentary election may be the only solution, while others are opposed.\\nMarine Le Pen is pushing for a snap election in the hope that her far-right National Rally party could gain seats. In last year's snap election, the far right gained ground but was held back in the final round by tactical voting and a left alliance. If an election is called, it is likely that Macron's centrist grouping would lose seats.\\nA majority of French people want parliament to be dissolved and a fresh parliamentary election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive.\\nMacron's second term as president runs until spring 2027 and he has always ruled out resigning. There were calls this week from some on the left, right and far right for Macron to resign but this is not expected.\\nIf Bayrou is ousted, the current French government would stay in place in a temporary, caretaker capacity to run domestic affairs until a new government is formed. This means policies on small boats would continue, including French policing of the northern coast, where people are departing for the UK. \\nKeir Starmer announced a “one in, one out” returns deal with France earlier this year whereby the UK would send some people arriving by small boat back to France in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain. That will continue. \\nFrench maritime authorities are continuing to study the possibility of a legal extension of French policing powers to the shallow waters off northern beaches, to prevent boats from departing.\", \"France is braced for another political crisis as the minority government of François Bayrou appears almost certain to be toppled in a confidence vote next month, amid deep political divisions over an unpopular austerity budget and debt-reduction plan.\\n“I will fight like a dog,” the centrist prime minister told L'Express on Tuesday after his surprise decision to call a vote of confidence from parliamentarians.\\nBayrou, 74, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, is expected to lose the vote as opposition parties on the far right and left said they would relish the opportunity to eject him after less than nine months in office.\\nBoris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliamentary group, told BFM TV: “We need to change politics and for that we need to change prime minister.” \\nBayrou's gamble – which involves Macron convening a special session of parliament on 8 September for a confidence vote that the prime minister has almost no chance of winning – has sparked fears of another political crisis less than a year after the previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over budget disagreements after only three months.\\nThe Paris stock market tumbled, shares in French banks sank and the country's borrowing costs rose on Tuesday as investors fretted.\\nA planned protest movement against Bayrou's proposed budget cuts, which gathered support on social media over the summer, as well as potential strikes and demonstrations by trade unions are expected to begin on 10 September, regardless of whether Bayrou is forced to quit.\\nThe beleaguered politician attended a meeting of the CFDT trade union on Tuesday where he urged French political parties to think carefully about the vote, noting they had 13 days to “say whether they are on the side of chaos or responsibility”.\\nBayrou said: “Is there or is there not a national emergency to rebalance the accounts, to escape excessive debt by choosing to reduce our deficits and produce more? That is the central question.”\\nIn what was seen as a last-minute appeal to the left, he said he was prepared to demand a “specific effort” from high-wealth individuals, after his budget proposals were widely criticised for affecting poor people and pensioners while having less impact on the very wealthy.\\nIf Bayrou is ousted, Macron would be dragged into domestic upheaval at a significant international moment for him, as he positions himself to play a role on Ukraine and the recognition of a Palestinian state.\\nUnder the French political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to run domestic affairs. Macron could swiftly appoint a new prime minister but they too could risk being ousted over the budget.\\nA source close to the far-right leader Marine Le Pen told Reuters it was hard to see how any new prime minister could escape being hit by a vote of no confidence.\\nLe Pen's party instead wants Macron to dissolve parliament and call a snap election. Macron said this summer he did not want to do this, but the justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Tuesday that an election could not be ruled out.\\nSince Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance took the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron's centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre. The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left.\\nThe interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, who leads the rightwing Les Républicains party that has propped up Bayrou, said it would be irresponsible and “against France's interests” to vote for the government to fall.\\nAt the heart of the crisis is Bayrou's unpopular and vague plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France's public debt. This includes scrapping two public holidays and freezing welfare spending and tax brackets. Hospital staff are concerned about deep cuts to the public health service.\\nPolls show voters on all political sides see the budget as unfair and letting the wealthiest off the hook. This summer, Bayrou became the least popular French prime minister since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, with one poll showing 80% of French people did not trust him.\\n• This article was amended on 27 August 2025. The left alliance took the largest number of seats in the 2024 French legislative election, not the most votes as an earlier version said.\", \"Good morning. France has bid adieu to its fourth prime minister in just over three years.\\nFrançois Bayrou, a 74-year-old tractor-driving centrist (who claimed to be a great consensus-builder), has been ousted after just nine months on the job for failing to do the thing he promised: find agreement in the French parliament.\\nThe vacancy is a poisoned chalice as there's every chance Bayrou's successor will also get shuffled off. This is because France's politicians cannot agree on how to tackle spiralling state deficits and debts. Underpinning it all is growing anger among voters who feel their quality of life is deteriorating, and that politicians are doing nothing about it.\\nIn the past 60 years of the Fifth Republic, France has never seen such political gridlock. For today's newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian's Paris correspondent, Angelique Chrisafis, about why France can't find a stable government and what could happen next. That's after the headlines.\\nPolitics | A trove of leaked data from Boris Johnson's private office reveals how the former prime minister has been profiting from influence he gained in office in a possible breach of ethics and lobbying rules. The files reveal Johnson lobbied a senior Saudi official he had met while in office and received more than £200,000 from a hedge fund after meeting Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro.\\nUK news | A series of senior female Labour MPs have dropped out of contention to replace Angela Rayner as the party's deputy leader, as a compressed timetable for nominations and worries about a potentially toxic atmosphere narrowed the field.\\nUS news | House Democrats released an image of a sexually suggestive letter and drawing that appears to bear the signature of Donald Trump, the very same note the president had denied writing after reports of its existence were published earlier this year.\\nFilm | Hundreds of film industry figures, including Olivia Colman, Mark Ruffalo and Ava DuVernay, have pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.\\nNepal | At least 19 people have been killed during protests in Nepal over a government ban on dozens of social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and X.\\nSince president Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election last year, there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly – a hung parliament, impossibly divided by their political imperatives.\\nIt is divided into three blocs – the left, centre and far right – which has made France nearly ungovernable. Unlike Germany, postwar France doesn't have the tradition of building coalition governments; rather than finding consensus, they have found themselves in crisis, and these divisions have shown up most when it comes to public spending.\\nBayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. The primary reason for his fall was his unpopular budget, which involved scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending. France faces acute pressure to repair its finances. Bayrou said his €44bn (£38bn) debt-reduction plan was needed because France's deficit hit 5.8% of gross domestic product last year – way above the official EU limit of 3%.\\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at €3.346tn, or 114% of GDP. Bayrou told the public that young people would be saddled with years of debt repayments “for the sake of the comfort of the boomers” if they failed to take action.\\nBayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation. “Part of Bayrou's problem was that he decided that he was going to be this great ‘truth-sayer' about the state of France's public finances. He said ‘look, we are collapsing under the weight of debt'. The public knows there hasn't been a balanced budget in France for several decades. Voters have this as one of their key concerns,” said Angelique Chrisafis.\\nHowever, in all his many TV interviews, he kept hammering home what a big problem debt is, while avoiding talking about who was responsible for it. Opposition parties want Macron to reflect on the impact his policies have had on public debt – notably his choice of pro-business economics in which taxes are cut for businesses and the very wealthy, which the left says has partially led the country into this mess, explains Angelique. “We're left in this position where parties can't agree on what went wrong,” she said.\\n“Macron's difficulty is that he is clinging desperately to his own economic approach, his pro-business stance of cutting the tax burden on businesses, which he says increases growth and productivity. But growth has not been as much as was expected.”\\nThe office of the French president said he would make a decision on the next prime minister “in the coming days”.\\n***\\nDeeper political crisis\\nUnderlying this is the deepening mistrust between people and their politicians (sound familiar?) that is likely to blight the country's politics until the 2027 presidential election and beyond.\\n“There is a sense of great disappointment that legislation, parliament and politics has not been addressing people's worries about the cost of living, about the state of public services. Many people who work in hospitals and the health system say they've faced years of cuts, which are making their jobs very difficult,” Angelique said.\\nResearch has shown poverty in France is increasing, with growing concentrations of inherited wealth sparking comparisons to the 19th century. Marion Carrel, sociology professor at the University of Lille, said there was a feeling of “the little people versus the big”, which gave a “pre-revolutionary” atmosphere.\\nNational Rally – the biggest single party in terms of votes in the National Assembly – is trying to capitalise on the instability to make electoral gains. “The far right is using this crisis to try and say, ‘Well, look, people always thought we weren't experienced enough to be in power, or that we'd bring some kind of chaos, but look at the instability now',” said Angelique. “Certainly the far right is a force to be reckoned with, and will continue to be up until the presidential election.”\\nAs France is the eurozone's second-biggest economy, this deadlock has implications for Europe as it is desperately trying to find unity in the face of three era-defining challenges: the war in Ukraine, trade tensions with the US, and the increasing dominance of China.\\n***\\nWhy can't France find a stable government?\\nThe centrist Macron is now tasked with appointing his third prime minister in a year, and the fifth since he took office in 2022. There is no obvious consensus figure to replace Bayrou.\\nMacron's protege Gabriel Attal left in September 2024 after he stayed on a caretaker role following last year's inconclusive snap election. Former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier followed him, but was toppled by a no-confidence vote in December, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern republic.\\nFrance is so divided politically that any new choice of prime minister could quite easily face a quick challenge – they will encounter deadlock in parliament, and find it impossible to push through a budget.\\n“We're in this great political fighting pit ahead of the local elections next spring 2026 and presidential in 2027. There is really no move for people to cooperate among this fragmented parliament,” said Angelique. “Macron now begins this strange period of trying to do the arithmetic to see whether there could be any kind of pact with other parties.”\\nMacron has said he'll stay in government until the end of his term, but is a lame duck if this political paralysis continues. A poll for Le Figaro magazine found just 15% of French people trust Macron to solve the crisis.\\nThe National Rally party are easily ahead in the polls, but probably wouldn't get an absolute majority, because there are many voters in France who would vote tactically to hold them back. “If we were to have a snap election right now, it could return exactly the same results currently in parliament,” said Angelique.\\n***\\nHow will the public respond?\\nNever shy to take to the streets, French people are expected to protest next week, in a movement known as Block Everything. This is likely to involve street demonstrations followed by union-led hospital and rail strikes. This could awake memories of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) – which led the anti-government protest movement in 2018 as well as the separate protest movement in 2023 against Macron's increase to the pension age.\\n“There's a lot of anger among people who are planning protests across France, whether it will be blockading shops or roads or roundabouts or protesting in the streets, and that is reflective of a great distrust between people in France and their politicians,” said Angelique.\\nMacron will be under pressure to find a new prime minister quickly to end uncertainty. “The pressure is on to try to convince its voters, its businesses and its international partners that it's stable, that it's not falling into an unsolvable moment of political crisis.”\\nI was moved by this piece on how we distract ourselves with screens and busyness, but as psychotherapist Moya Sarner argues, transformation comes only by diving deep into the pain holding us back.

That's why the diversity and equality and inclusion strategies and the focus on it are so important.\\n“Because the lines that are being trotted out around ‘we should treat everybody equally' – yeah, we should. Everybody should experience the same quality of service from policing or the public sector, but unfortunately they don't.\\n“And to level up that confidence gap, that difference in service, you have to have some dedicated resources to do that, both inside the organisation, focusing internally on your culture, and externally.\\n“To say that you can … lessen that confidence gap, to say that you can make sure that everybody is experiencing the same quality of service without some dedicated resources to do it is just ludicrous.”\\nKennedy's retirement from policing, leaves her free to voice not just her concerns, but also those of other senior figures concerned by intense attacks on policing by rightwing political figures.\\nShe said political attacks on diversity and inclusion, and groups targeting asylum hotels, were causing problems on the streets and for her workforce, leaving some people frightened: “Seeing the disorder that's out on the streets, some of the narrative coming out around immigration status, colour of your skin, it must be really frightening out there, in our communities, but also for our own workforce.\\n“So I do think we're on a bit of a tipping point at this moment, and I think we need to work really hard not to go backwards.”\\nThe toughest challenge in her four years as chief was the July 2024 murder of three schoolgirls, Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, after a man burst into a Southport dance class and stabbed several children.\\nThe next day a vigil to commemorate those murdered was soon followed in the Merseyside town by riots that spread across the country and were the worst in more than a decade.\\nKennedy said there was a far-right and organised element. “The officers on the ground report that there was carfuls of people turning up and being dropped off … There was an element of organisation for that. So those numbers swelled very quickly … Within 25 minutes of the vigil ending, the first missiles were thrown at the mosque.”\\nKennedy said claims those taking to the street were typical of white working-class anger were contradicted by the fact that white working-class people turned out in greater numbers to repair the attacked mosque and clear up.\\nIn the aftermath of the murders there was a rapid and deliberate spread of false information, designed to whip up trouble, falsely claiming the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Kennedy and her force took the unusual step on the evening of the atrocity of releasing the information that the suspect was British-born.\\nThe chief constable said she doubted that a quicker release of information would have defused tensions that led to the riots.\\nShe pointed to this May's incident where a car went into crowds celebrating Liverpool FC's Premier League title victory. The incident in Liverpool city centre led to fears of a terrorist attack, which it was not, but also a rapid and determined spread of lies online.\\nKennedy recalled how her force released ethnicity details of a man it had arrested, but, she said: “Even when we put out that this was a white, British-born local person … because what we'd put out didn't suit the narrative that they wanted to swell in terms of that negativity, people carried on with that misinformation.”\\nShe said she was annoyed by politicians such as Farage, who in the aftermath of the Southport riot said the authorities might be wrongly hiding key details from the public. She said: “I was really frustrated that national politicians were making some of the statements that they were making … because of the impact that it was having in terms of trust and confidence in policing. And it wasn't in my view based on fact, it was based on what was being said on social media.”\\nKennedy said claims of two-tier policing were “a ludicrous statement”, and added: “Some of the statements being said by national politicians are having an impact on what is playing out on our streets and what policing, communities and partners are being left to deal with.”\\nShe dismissed claims of asylum seekers being more likely to commit crime and said: “I'm not seeing anything out of kilter … It's just, it's more newsworthy.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is really important frankly that people support our police rather than just attacking them continually.\\n“As we have seen, Reform is one day calling for chief constables to resign, the next it is attacking women police officers who are out on our streets every single day of the week.”\\nFarage has repeatedly weighed into the debate about the Epping migrant hotel and said this week: “Hard-left groups, Stand Up to Racism and Antifa, were given the red carpet treatment by Essex police, with the force literally escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest. They have been caught red-handed helping to light the fuse that led to violence.”\\nHarrington said Reform's claims were “categorically wrong” and that officers had organised a cordon around activists exercising their right to protest.\\nDal Babu, a former chief superintendent for the Metropolitan police, said Farage's claims were wrong and he should correct the public record amid rising tensions.\\n“British values mean if a politician makes a mistake, they put their hand up and acknowledge it. He knows it is false,” Babu said.\\nOn Thursday, Epping Forest district council unanimously voted to support a motion calling for the immediate closure of the Bell hotel for the purpose of asylum processing and for the “managed closure” of the Phoenix hotel. The vote was non-binding and purely symbolic.\\nDuring the meeting Chris Whitbread, the leader of the council, reiterated that the local authority had no say on the use of the hotels and the decision was up to the Home Office, who he accused of “not being overly cooperative” when safeguarding concerns were raised.\\nHundreds of protesters, including many women and children, began marching from Epping town centre to the hotel at about 6pm in heavy rain. A ramped-up police operation included fences and a ban on the wearing of facial coverings.\\nAn 18-year-old man was arrested for breaching a section 60AA order, which prevents anyone wearing a face covering.\\nPolice have arrested 17 people in total over protests in Epping.\\nActivists from the far-right Homeland group were behind an Epping Says No! Facebook group that has been behind much of the promotion of the protests. Members of Patriotic Alternative and White Vanguard have also been involved.\\nWhile politicians have largely stayed away from the protest, two Reform councillors were present outside the Epping hotel last week, including James Regan who claimed in an interview that “they're trying to dilute the Englishness out of us”.\\nThe Guardian also found evidence that a Reform official shared a platform in Epping with an agitator from Homeland.\\nIn last year's summer riots, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, called out “far-right thuggery” and pledged to bring those involved to justice.\\nHowever, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Thursday that many of the Epping protesters were “upset for legitimate reasons”.\\nAngela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, told the cabinet earlier this week that immigration and deprivation were among the main factors causing public disenchantment with politicians.\\nThere is already a taskforce on community cohesion, informed by experts and officials, while a £1.5bn “plan for neighbourhoods” aims to invest in 75 deprived areas over the next decade.\\nSome Labour MPs are concerned that political and media language about the UK being on the brink of social unrest may be raising tensions rather than encouraging cohesion.\\nStella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said on Thursday that if people were “unsettled by the political and press debate around immigration, law and order, the idea that there could be race riots again, you are completely right to be concerned because this discussion in itself is raising fear and uncertainty and tension”.\\nShe added: “It is dividing us and feeding this myth that Britain is a nation that cannot manage diversity rather than one that draws strength from it.”\\nBrendan Cox, whose wife, Jo, a Labour MP, was murdered by a far-right extremist, said the UK needed a longer-term strategy on social cohesion.\\n“There is a set of local concerns around this in Epping and it's also true that these are being co-opted and used by elements of the far right,” said Cox, who is the convener of an independent commission on community.\\n“It's no surprise that happens when there are these kind of festering legitimate concerns and successive governments are seen to not act on those.\\n“But the broad point I'd make is that we've published a report about there being a tinderbox … and I think what's really clear is that we don't really have any long-term cohesion strategy at all.”\\nNick Lowles, of the Hope not Hate campaign group, said: “We are concerned that policing has not caught up with the new post-organisation nature of the far right, where individuals can emerge and play a role on social media and inciting or directing violence, without ever being a member of a far-right organisation.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court and will stand trial next month.\\nA Reform official would not answer questions about sharing a platform with the far right or about Cooper's claims that the party should back the police.\\nInstead the spokesperson said the Guardian “cares more about attacking Reform UK than defending young girls who are being abused by illegal boat migrants”.\", \"Shabana Mahmood knows what it is like to live in an area where crime feels out of control. While she was growing up in Small Heath in inner-city Birmingham in the 1980s and 90s, her father kept a cricket bat behind the till of the family shop to fend off would-be robbers.\\nThree decades later, Mahmood is Labour's justice secretary and lord chancellor, tasked with cutting crime at a time when public concern about it is rising.\\nThough violent crime has fallen steadily over decades, recent increases in highly visible offences including shoplifting and snatch theft have contributed to a feeling of lawlessness and insecurity.\\nFanning the flames are politicians including Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and Robert Jenrick, Mahmood's Conservative counterpart, who have sought to draw a link between crime – particularly sexual assault – and immigration.\\nFor Mahmood, being the daughter of immigrants is central to her worldview about justice. “She feels very strongly that being British is a responsibility as well as a right,” a source close to her said. “She really does feel like it's an affront when people who come here are afforded the welcome that she and her family were, but break the laws of the land.”\\nAnother politician shaped by his upbringing as the child of immigrant parents was Rishi Sunak, who felt strongly that it was an injustice for people to arrive illegally in Britain on small boats. Though their backgrounds and politics are very different, Mahmood and Sunak crossed paths at Oxford in the late 90s, with a teenage Sunak pledging his support for Mahmood when she stood for president of the Lincoln college student union.\\nLast week, she received the surprise endorsement of another high-profile Tory: Michael Gove. Asked by the Politics Inside Out podcast to choose this government's standout figure, he replied without hesitation: Shabana Mahmood. Mahmood is a politician with “a totally coherent worldview” who “embodies in some respects the Labour coalition”, he said.\\nMahmood has a growing number of admirers inside the Labour party, too. Having been a central figure in the Keir Starmer project from its early days, she is highly rated by No 10 and is thought of as one of its most effective ministers. A cabinet colleague said she “never wastes a word” in meetings, and recently warned that the government was still caught up in an opposition mindset and preoccupied with taking on the left instead of speaking to the concerns of the country more widely. She has also been a leading advocate for the UK to take a more pro-Palestinian stance, including on statehood.\\nThose who have worked with Mahmood praise her political nous. This year, she emerged unscathed from a clash with Jenrick over new sentencing guidelines that would have made an offender's ethnicity or faith a greater factor when deciding whether to jail them. She forced the Sentencing Council to back down and has ordered a review of its role.\\nEarly on, she also clashed with Richard Hermer, the attorney general, amid claims he was obstructing aspects of the government's agenda. Colleagues say the pair get on well personally but come from different traditions. “Shabana believes, above all else, in parliamentary sovereignty and the value of our common law system. That makes her more of a reformer on things like the ECHR, [European convention on human rights]” a source close to her said. A former Conservative minister said: “She has much better political antennae than Lord Hermer – she recognises that the law ultimately has to command public confidence.”\\nOne source who has worked with her in a previous role said: “Her instincts are so well honed, it's quite something. It's a product of a number of things, she comes from a very political family and a very febrile political environment in Birmingham.” Her father was chair of the Birmingham Labour party and would host meetings for organisers – including Tom Watson, the future deputy Labour leader – in his living room over tea and samosas.\\nUnusually among politicians, she has spoken about the importance of her faith. “It is the absolute core of my life,” she told Gove in an interview with the Spectator. “It's where I draw my sense of duty and public service from. My understanding of Islam, how I've practised Islam my whole life has been about viewing life as a gift from God but it's also a test from God.”\\n“She is a very defined politician with a real instinct for the times,” said Charlie Falconer, who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair. “She is somebody who does understand politics in a profound way, and having been the campaign coordinator for Labour for quite some time she knows what has to be done in order to win elections.”\\nMahmood was elected to parliament in 2010 and within six months was promoted to a shadow frontbench role. In Starmer's shadow cabinet, she spent more than two years as national campaign coordinator, a role in which she became indispensable to the strategy chief, Morgan McSweeney. She is credited for helping secure the narrow but fateful win in the 2021 Batley and Spen byelection, without which Starmer would probably have faced a leadership challenge that summer.\\nIn the justice department, she has arguably inherited the most difficult situation of any minister. In her first week, she announced the early release of thousands of criminals in response to the overcrowding crisis in English and Welsh prisons. “She knows she has got two things she has got to do in the justice department: get it out of this constant cycle of crisis and also use it to actually cut crime,” said the source close to her.\\nShe has set out plans for reforming the criminal justice system, which have ranged from chemical castration for serious sex offenders to allowing criminals to spend less time in prison and instead be rehabilitated in the community. She has taken inspiration from Texas, where there is a blend of hardline and progressive measures. “She's not bowed down by an ideological approach to these things. She can blend some populism in with what are very strong values,” said the person who worked with her in the past.\\nMahmood's experience of government so far has convinced her of the need to rewire the state and empower elected politicians over officials and quangos. “Shabana is starting to be seen particularly as a leader of ‘if we need to break things, we should break things' … She has come to really believe in the depths of state failure,” one MP close to her said. In a speech in Strasbourg this summer, she announced that the UK would seek reform of the European convention on human rights amid concerns about it being cited to block the deportation of dangerous offenders.\\nThe justice secretary has a busy autumn in store, starting with plans to introduce a bill in September to deliver her sentencing reforms including shorter prison sentences for some offenders. Before the end of the year, she intends to set out the other half of her reform agenda to tackle the groaning backlog in crown courts, after a review by Brian Leveson recommended that some offences be tried without a jury.\\nHowever she performs in government, by the time of the next election Mahmood may face her biggest challenge at home. Her majority in Birmingham Ladywood dropped from nearly 30,000 in 2019 to 3,400 last year after a challenge from a pro-Gaza independent candidate. Zarah Sultana, the independent MP who is starting a party with Jeremy Corbyn, is said to have designs on the seat.\\nAllies of Mahmood say that her challengers face an uphill struggle. “She is much more deeply embedded in her community than others who lost or came close to losing were,” the source close to her said.\\nIn parliament in recent months, Mahmood has hosted dinners with small groups of Labour MPs interested in the reforms she is planning.\\nSome on the backbenches have begun to see her as a future leader. “If she ever put the hat in the ring, it would be because she wanted the debate to be rigorous and bold and she wanted to be the person who forced that kind of honesty,” the MP close to her said. “But it tends to be the case that the people who propagate that kind of message don't win.”\"]"

Anyone who works in security will also pick up on how they were standing. If you looked you could see they held their hands together to give a discreet thumbs up sign,” said the man, reluctant like so many other local people to go on the record, but who gave his name as “Steve Davis”.\\nThe only problem with this analysis was: it appeared to be entirely wrong.\\nEssex police has “categorically” denied it bussed in antiracism protesters. The suggestion of state-sponsored “false flag” provocateurs – a frequent trope advanced on niche corners of social media at times of tensions on the streets – was also dismissed.\\nThe denials have often come too late to stop the conspiracies taking hold. They have been eagerly spread by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, and also carried on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.\\nDisinformation has been one of the most alarming characteristics of the violent protests in Epping, whose focus has been the use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers.\\nLocal people have continued to turn out for the protests, which were sparked after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault – but far-right activists have played a key role in promoting them online. Activists from groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present.\\nOnline misinformation and disinformation originating on niche corners of X has been amplified – seemingly without attempt to corroborate whether it is true – by politicians such as Farage and commenters from the GB News channel.\\nVideo clips of Stand Up to Racism protesters being taken out of Epping last Thursday in police vans, after they were surrounded by groups of men who threw projectiles at them and the police, were quickly repurposed on social media – and presented as if they were images of protesters being transported from Epping station.\\nIn fact, as Essex police has confirmed, the Stand Up to Racism protesters had made their way on foot from the station earlier in the day, while police escorted them on foot to enable them to exercise a right to protest.\\nBy Friday, however, rightwing commenters such as the ex-GB News presenter Dan Wootton were also misrepresenting the footage. “They actually escorted people in police vans,” Wootton told the viewers of the online show he set up after leaving GB News.\\nOn Wednesday, Farage posted the same footage on X, saying: “This video proves [police] transported leftwing protesters to the Bell hotel in Epping” and calling for the resignation of the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington.\\nThe force issued a statement saying this was categorically untrue, while Harrington made pointed comments in a press conference where he urged commenters to be responsible for what they said online, adding that it had “real-world consequences”.\\nFarage modulated his language after he was contacted on Wednesday, saying the police were “escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest”, but his original tweet remains on X.\\nLater on Thursday, and in a tweet shortly after 10pm on Wednesday, Farage went on GB News to say he had received a call from a police officer who was in charge of the operation to say he was wrong. “If I was slightly out on accuracy I apologise but I think the gist of what I was saying was right,” he said.\\nBy then, however, the misinformation had spread like wildfire and done “real damage”, according to Lewis Nielsen of Stand Up to Racism.\\n“It is a complete lie to say, as Farage has claimed, that Stand Up to Racism protesters were ‘bussed in'. We are mobilising antiracists, trade unionists, campaigners and faith groups against the far right in Epping,” he said.\\nYet more conspiracies – some outlandish, others more minor but corrosive – continue to circulate. They include unsubstantiated accusations that asylum seekers staying at the hotel are routinely shoplifting in Epping.\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was among conspiracy theories being disseminated in online spaces including the Epping Says No! Facebook group, which has more than 1,600 members. Its administrators include activists from the far-right Homeland party, Adam Clegg and Callum Barker.\\nThe claims of undercover police officers being among the antiracism protesters have been accompanied by clips and pictures zeroing in on pictures of some of those protesters.\\nThe claims were also denied by Essex police, which has been trying to combat what it calls “myths” in videos fronted by an assistant chief constable. The force specifically picked out the claim that there were “police decoys in the crowd encouraging violence”, rebutting it on its YouTube channel.\\nNielsen also denied the claim: “It is categorically false that the police are involved in Stand Up to Racism protests, or play any role in organising them. If anything our protests – like others – have faced police repression in recent years.”\", \"Hundreds of people gathered outside a hotel in Epping on Sunday for the fifth time to demonstrate over the premises being used to house asylum seekers, as protests spread to other hotels over the weekend.\\nA large police presence containing officers from multiple forces restricted contact between anti- and pro-immigrant protesters, with Essex police saying restrictions were necessary after what it described as repeated serious disruption, violence and harm to the community since the first demonstration took place on 13 July.\\nTwo men were charged with public order offences after a protest of about 400 anti-immigration and 250 counter-protesters outside a hotel in Diss on Saturday, Norfolk constabulary said. There was a further protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf in London on Sunday, with the number of protesters appearing to be in the low hundreds.\\nThe demonstration in Epping in Essex on Sunday – where as many as 500 anti-immigrant protesters gathered behind metal barriers outside the Bell hotel – was the latest in a series of protests that began after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault for allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and is in custody.\\nProtesters wore T-shirts and held up signs bearing the slogan “protect our kids”, while others waved England flags. Other flags seen included one for Reform UK, and a white flag with a red cross on a blue square, as seen in the US at anti-abortion demonstrations.\\nCounter-protesters held banners including one that read “Don't let the far right divide us with their hatred and violence”, and “Care for refugees”. They chanted “Refugees are welcome here” and “Nazi scum off our streets”.\\nPolice said three people were arrested during the peaceful protest, two from the anti-hotel protest group and the other from the counter-protest group. “I want to thank those who attended for the peaceful nature of both protests,” said Ch Supt Simon Anslow of Essex police. “I am pleased that today has passed off without incident and I am grateful to our colleagues from other forces for their support.”\\nIn a letter sent to the Guardian, asylum seekers said “harmful stereotypes” about refugees did not reflect the truth. “There are some refugees who do not behave respectfully or who do not follow the rules of the host society. But those individuals do not represent all of us,” they said. “As with any group of people, there are both good and bad – and it is unfair to judge the majority by the actions of a few.”\\nThe letter mentioned fleeing persecution and violence. “We refugees are not here to take advantage of the system. We are here to rebuild our lives, to work, and to contribute,” they wrote, adding: “This letter is not a plea for sympathy, but a call for understanding and fairness.”\\nOutside the Bell hotel, one local woman, who did not want to be named, said residents had complained about an increase in antisocial incidents since it began housing asylum seekers but felt ignored and unfairly labelled as “far right”.\\n“I'm not saying everyone in any of these hotels is up to no good. I'm not going to judge everyone, but there is no vetting,” she said. “We won't stop until they start listening and shut this hotel down.”\\nActivists from far-right groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present at previous protests. On Sunday Kai Stephens, the Norfolk branch organiser for Homeland, held a sign that said: “Put local people first.”\\nStephens said: “Unfortunately, there has to be a certain point where we turn around and say, the British people should be put first, the indigenous British people.”\\nSupporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson were also present. Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had said he would attend before changing his mind and saying it would not be helpful to protesters.\\nOther local protesters said far-right agitators were not welcome. “It's 100% unhelpful, because it just gives them a message which is not what we're trying to achieve here,” said one man, who did not want to be named.\\nStand Up to Racism, the group that organised the counter-protest, estimated about 700 people had gone to Epping. Lewis Nielsen, an officer at Stand Up to Racism, said Nigel Farage's Reform UK had emboldened the far right.\\n“It's a really dangerous situation at the moment because you haven't just got the protest here, you've got other protests coming up around the country,” Nielsen said. “We stopped the riots last August with these kinds of mobilisations, and that's why we're pleased the one today has been successful.”\\nOne protester, Joshua Bailey, who said he grew up in Epping, said increasing anti-immigration sentiment had made people of colour in his friend group feel vulnerable and threatened. “It's very important that we have a positive stance towards refugees, who are people fleeing genuine tragedy and disaster.”\\nHe said he did not agree with chants that labelled protesters as fascists or Nazis. “There is room for nuance,” he said. “I'd like to be able to sit down in a pub with someone who had opposing views and be able to speak about it.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It is the first time since last summer's riots that there has been a mass and national standing up of specialist public order officers.\\nSome of the extra riot officers will be deployed on the streets, kitted out in helmets and shields to act as a deterrent. Others will be held in reserve and all will be on standby to be rushed across England and Wales to hotspots of violence and rising tension, a police source with knowledge of the planning for this weekend said.\\nThe same source stressed there was no specific intelligence of violence, but 800 extra riot officers were ordered to be made ready on Friday, on top of the 2,200 planned already.\\nAt least 20 protests targeting hotels used by the government to house asylum seekers are thought possible this weekend, with each one in turn potentially attracting a counter-protest. \\nAs of 8pm on Friday, 10 protests against asylum seekers had attracted numbers ranging from the dozens to about 100, according to Hope Not Hate, which monitors extremist groups.\\nStand Up to Racism said about 130 of its supporters had faced about 80 protesters in Leeds. In Chestnut, about 100 protesters against asylum seekers faced 10 anti-racism activists with handmade signs. The group said it had a major mobilisation in Islington, facing about 10 on the other side.\\nOne senior officer in an area expecting a protest said: “It is impossible to tell what you are going to get.

In some areas public order officers may deploy in full riot gear from the start to act as a deterrent. Other forces will prefer to have officers in regular uniforms, so called “soft hats”, to start with, with fully kitted riot officers in reserve and close by if trouble erupts.\\nThe far right is involved in some, if not most, of the protests but those attending are expected to include local people concerned by claims linking asylum seeker hotels to serious crime.\\nPolice public order resources this weekend face a pincer movement from right and left.\\nThe Metropolitan police is calling in support from other forces as it faces three days of substantial public order challenges, including an anti-migrant protest in Islington, north London, on Friday night, with more are expected at another in Canary Wharf on Sunday.\\nOn Saturday in central London there will be a pro-Palestine march, along with a protest encouraging supporters of Palestine Action – and opponents of its ban under terrorism laws – to dare police to arrest them.\\nOrganisers and police sources agree privately hundreds are likely to turn up, the range likely to be 200 to just under 1,000, encouraged to hold placards containing the words “I support Palestine Action”, which police say will lead to arrest.\\nOrganisers hope to stretch to breaking point the police and criminal justice system's ability to deal with a mass defiance. Police believe they will manage unless the numbers exceed expectations.\\nIn London, small groups of protesters started to gather from about 5pm on Friday across the road from the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf. Riot police scrambled to keep groups of masked men who broke away from the anti-asylum seeker protest from reaching a separate group of anti-racism activists who had attempted to walk down to the hotel.\\nAbout 200 anti-migrant protesters – including men waving St George's flags and an Israeli flag – had gathered across the road from the hotel, with some hurling abuse at a Stand Up to Racism protest of about 100 activists, trade unionists and others.\\nPolice kept a distance but vans with public order officers were also stationed in streets nearby. Two people were arrested.\\nOn Sunday in London, there will be a march in support of the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attack, as well as football's Community Shield match. The start of football's lower divisions this weekend will also require police resources.\\nMetropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan, who will lead the policing operation, warned people who want to protest against the banning of Palestine Action that they should expect a terrorism charge.\\nShe said: “Anyone showing support for Palestine Action can expect to be arrested. An arrest under the Terrorism Act can have very real long-term implications – from travel, to employment, to finances.”\\nThere was some unease in Nuneaton on Friday afternoon, before what is expected to be a big turnout at a protest outside the council building on Saturday.\\nThe Warwickshire town has become a target for far-right activists in recent days, after two Afghan men were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old girl. They have now been charged in relation to the alleged incident.\\nThe Reform UK council leader, 19-year-old George Finch, accused the police of covering up the claim that the men, Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir, are asylum seekers.\\nA group of retired women sitting outside a cafe said they supported the protest. “I think it's good … They're only protecting the children. That's all they're doing,” said one woman, who would not give her name because “you can't have an opinion because you'll get locked up”.\\nWarwickshire's police chief constable, Alex Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to Finch on Wednesday, writing that the police had asked the Home Office to confirm the immigration status of the two men accused in connection with the alleged rape, and “did not and will not cover up such criminality”.\\nCare workers Chijioke “CJ” Ani and Musa Samson, both originally from Nigeria, had also heard about the protest. Ani said he would go to work and go home, and not stay in the town on Saturday.\\nHe said he had seen a lot of anti-immigration sentiment on social media. “Some of them are misinformed or acting out of impulse,” he said. “It makes me feel like someone will attack me someday. It's definitely getting worse because the far right are getting stronger.”\\nWhile the men, originally from Nigeria, had found Nuneaton to be a friendly town, Samson said he had experienced some racism with men making noises at him as he approached a local bar. \\nMost people the Guardian spoke to in Nuneaton said they would be avoiding the town centre.\\nLawrence McIntyre was serving teas and coffees from The Kiosk in the town centre. He said: “I do feel sorry if it does put people off coming down shopping.

The mutual aid collective Black Trans Travel Fund provided her with $250 to buy an outfit, pay for a car service from New York City to New Jersey for the funeral and to purchase food while she was there. “I was able to get what I needed to get there, I was able to have water, I was able to buy things; my basic needs were met in that moment,” Gonzalez said. “Funerals are expensive. It helped me … show up in a way that was respectful.”\\nFounded in 2019, Black Trans Travel Fund began as a ride program for Black trans people in New York and New Jersey to pay for car services such as Lyft twice a week. It has since expanded to a global funding source for people who need help paying for TSA pre-check, flights, passports and emergencies, with an eye toward self autonomy so that trans people have a say in how they spend the money. Safe transportation is of particular importance to the Black trans community, since they're at increased risk for harassment and violence when cycling, walking or using public transit. At least 32 trans and gender nonconforming people were killed in 2024, with 56% of them being Black trans women, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\\nBut Black Trans Travel Fund is strapped for resources since individual donations have declined in recent months due to fear around the Trump administration's policies targeting trans people, said the group's founder and co-director Devin Michael Lowe. “With the political climate that we're in, the cost of food is skyrocketing, housing costs have skyrocketed,” Lowe told the Guardian. “And there's been so much backlash against trans people all across the country.”\\nOver the past year, the group has had to adjust its programs in the face of an increasingly anti-trans political climate. Following Trump's executive order that only two sexes, male and female, would be recognized by the government, several transgender people told Lowe that the US Department of State confiscated their passports when they tried to renew them. So in February, the group paused its sponsorship of passports and plane tickets to avoid putting trans people in further danger.\\nFollowing a June preliminary injunction on the Trump administration's policy requiring that a person's passport reflect their sex assigned at birth, though, the organization recently began sponsoring passports again for trans women in the US. And due to the US's cuts to foreign aid and development assistance, the group has focused much of its efforts on helping Black trans women in other nations, including Uganda, seek safety.\\n“People have had some really serious concerns about their capacity to travel lately,” Lowe said. Trans women who need to travel for work “have concerns about facing harassment at the airport, or not getting their documents”. Lowe said that for transgender people preparing to travel, their “mental health is being impacted deeply. People are stressed out about what are going to be the continued effects.”\\nTrump's recent executive orders targeting trans people, “really has us in a whirlwind”, Lowe said. “And I think that is one of the tactics. Fascism makes it difficult for you to do anything. They want us to be overwhelmed by the amount of things that are happening at once, and it feels undefeatable.”\\nLaunched by Lowe, a Black trans man in the Bronx neighborhood of New York City, the Black Trans Travel Fund was originally created as a way to safely transport Black trans women to and from Pride events six years ago. In May 2019, three Black trans women – Muhlaysia Booker, Claire Legato, and Tamika Washington – were fatally shot in the span of a week. Lowe attended a rally in New York City about the murders affecting his community, in which he said white politicians paid “lip service” about the need to combat the violence without taking any action. So Lowe decided to take matters into his own hands by soliciting donations through social media, resulting in him raising $20,000 within a few weeks.\\n“One of the core values of Black Trans Travel Fund is autonomy over what they're doing,” Lowe said. “I can't tell you the amount of times that a woman has told me her experience of getting assaulted or harassed on the metro. So I wanted to ensure that when people are receiving support, they're able to utilize it in a way that feels safest for them.” According to the Black Trans Travel Fund, the team utilized more than $385,000 over five years to allow hundreds of people to pay for Uber rides, train tickets or gas for their friends' cars through their bi-weekly ride sponsorship program.\\nThe flagship ride program was paused in 2024 due to a loss of funding. But with additional resources, Lowe and his team hope to restart it in the future. Altogether, Lowe said that the organization has donated more than $730,000 to help people around the world with travel, housing and medical costs since its inception. The group recently launched a $500,000 fundraising campaign to increase their mutual aid efforts and to make traveling more accessible for even more Black trans women.\\nIn the face of limited budget cuts and executive orders, the fund has pivoted its focus to providing emergency support to trans women globally, where applicants receive $200 within a couple of days to leave abusive environments, to cover funeral arrangement costs, or to pay for safe transportation to medical appointments.\\nIn recent months, the Black Trans Travel Fund has received emergency requests from people throughout the world who need access to HIV medication due to the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID, a governmental agency that provided foreign aid and development assistance. “We really do not discriminate to the best of our ability,” Lowe said. “We have a limited amount of funding each month, so if we do receive an overwhelming number of requests we will try to prioritize the ones that feel the most urgent.”\\nThe organization has also focused its efforts on a grant program to support Black trans-led organizations and shelter spaces domestically and internationally. Over the past year, the group has provided 11 organizations with nearly $16,000. Some of the funding has gone toward rent, food, transportation and hygiene supplies for Black trans people affected by HIV and Aids at Devin's House of Hope, a shelter in Uganda named after Lowe.\\nIn Uganda, where an anti-LGBTQ+ law passed two years ago, trans people are arrested, detained and extorted for money by authorities. The harsh political climate has led to harassment and discrimination on the streets, Lowe said, and it's difficult for trans people to rent housing.\\n“Even though trans people [in the US] are navigating homelessness and joblessness as well, there are more protections here legally in terms of us at least being able to apply to housing if you have the money,” Lowe said, “Whereas a lot of folks internationally are getting kicked out for ‘homosexual behavior', like neighbors will tell people's landlords.”\\nThe Black Trans Travel Fund helped Ruthra Lubega, a Black trans man from Kampala, Uganda, escape from the nation and seek asylum in New York last year. Lubega met Lowe at a meeting of LGBTQ+ leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, in 2022. At the time, Lubega was homeless, and wanted to create a shelter for trans people living with HIV/Aids. Later that year, the Black Trans Travel Fund raised funds for rent and bedding supplies to launch Devin's House of Hope, where more than 180 trans people from throughout Africa have sought safety. The travel fund has also helped the shelter purchase a car and a motorbike for Lubega to distribute HIV medication and condoms throughout the community.\\n“During my work and advocacy I used to face many challenges,” Lubega told the Guardian. “I was in prison many times because of my gender identity. I was beaten many times.” Then last summer, Lubega said that his photo appeared in a Ugandan newspaper's list of “top human rights defenders that recruit young women to homosexuality”. Lubega's life was at risk due to the anti-LGBTQ+ law, so the Black Trans Travel Fund raised money for him to fly to New York.\\nNow, Lubega lives in a New York shelter and is trying to attain his green card as he continues to run Devin's House of Hope from afar. Lubega said that ever since he learned of Black Trans Travel Fund, “they have done a great job of changing the lives of Black trans women and men in Uganda.”\\nIn the face of global trans misogynoir, the Black Trans Travel Fund team also sponsors events for their community to celebrate their lives and experience joy. The group is now raising money to provide trans women with funding for rides following a Black trans women cookout at New York City's Socrates Sculpture Park on 24 August. And at in the fall, they plan to host a fundraising event to raise money for a ball in Kingston, Jamaica, in November.\", \"The number of LGBTQ+ Americans inquiring about moving to Canada has soared since Donald Trump's re-election, campaigners have said, as people across the US wrestle with the fallout of rising anti-gay rhetoric, anti-trans executive orders, and the more than 600 bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights.\\n“So much is happening in the US right now and a lot of it is terrifying,” said Latoya Nugent of Rainbow Railroad, a North American charity that helps LGBTQI+ individuals escape violence and persecution in their home countries.\\nIn the first eight months of this year, the organisation has received 4,197 calls from people living in the US – a surge of 760% compared with the same period last year. “The overwhelming majority of individuals who are reaching out want support with international relocation, which translates to ‘I want to get out of the US because I'm afraid of living here,'” said Nugent.\\nThe phones at Rainbow Railroad – which usually receives about 12,000 calls a year from around the world – began lighting up in November, as more than 1,100 calls poured in within 24 hours after Trump's re-election. “For the first time in our history, the US emerged as the number one country where people request help from,” said Nugent.\\nThe trend seems likely to continue this year. “A significant number of them are reporting that they're fearful of what may happen to them, given the political climate and the emerging policy and legal landscape for LGBTQI+ people,” Nugent said.\\nSince returning to office this year, Trump has carried out an unprecedented assault on the community: announcing that the US would only recognise two genders; targeting diversity, equity and inclusion measures; and signing executive orders that sought to exclude transgender people from the US military, limit their access to sport, and curtail gender-transition procedures for people under 19.\\nThe president's first 100 days in office saw LGBTQ+ individuals targeted at least 255 times, both via policy shifts and rhetoric, according to the US advocacy organisation Glaad.\\nPoliticians in some US states have seized on the moment, presenting 604 anti-LGBTQ+ bills at the state level, according to tracking by the American Civil Liberties Union. Republicans in red states have sought measures that target same-sex marriage, while in May, Utah became the first state to explicitly bar the flying of LGBTQ+ flags at government buildings and schools. More than a dozen states soon followed with similar bans.\\nAt Rainbow Railroad, about 61% of callers from the US identify as trans, said Nugent, reflecting the administration's constant and relentless targeting of trans individuals.\\nOthers told the organisation that they were nervously watching the attacks play out. “If you are aware of what's happening globally, you know that this is the beginning of the worst that is to come,” she said. “In the US, trans-identified people have become the first line of attack against the entire LGBTQI+ community, and there's this growing fear that it will not stop there.”\\nDespite the growing fears, the current Canadian options for those who feel persecuted in the US remain slim. Those who call Rainbow Railroad are told that the most likely options for relocation are via economic pathways or via family reunification.\\nHope, however, has been sparked by two recent immigration cases.\\nIn July, a Canadian judge halted plans to deport a non-binary artist from Minnesota, arguing that the decision had failed to take into account the “current conditions for LGBTQ, non-binary and transgender persons” in the US. Since then, debate has swirled over the extent to which the precedent will force immigration officials in Canada to consider the current climate for people in the US.\\nAnother case that is being closely watched is that of a 22-year-old transgender woman from Arizona. After crossing into Canada earlier this year, Hannah Kreager filed an asylum claim in June, on the grounds that Trump's anti-trans policies have left her fearing persecution.\\nHer lawyer, Yameena Ansari, described the case as potentially precedent-setting, in that it could recognise how the Trump administration has specifically targeted the LGBTQ+ community in the US. With these claims, “historically we're talking about people from east Africa, west Africa, we're talking about people from Russia or from Islamic countries, we are not talking about America,” she said. “But with each day that goes by, I feel more and more convinced that she has a legitimate claim.”\\nThe claim, which Ansari said could be heard as early as next summer, has sparked debate across the country, with many pointing to fact that refugees in Canada must demonstrate that they cannot obtain protection from their home state and that they are unable to relocate to a safe place anywhere within their own country.\\nThe last point, in particular, has left Ansari preparing to show that there is no other US state in which her client could be safe. “If she goes into a federal building, she cannot pee in the right bathroom,” she said. “If she's locked up in a federal institution, where are they going to lock her up? Are they going to lock her up in the male institution? Are they going to provide her with gender-affirming care?”\\nFrom the start, her client had understood that this route was far from guaranteed. But she had seized on it, seeing it as a singular chance to carve out a safe exit path for herself and the many others reeling from the Trump administration's constant and relentless attacks, said Ansari. “She's not just doing this for herself. For her, this is very much a cause.”\\nThe glimmer of hope had led to a raft of calls from others in similar situations, she added. “Already just her courage in bringing this forward has inspired a lot of people in her community,” she said. “Right now I have so many more clients coming to me. Why? Because they read about Hannah's case and they know there's some lawyer who sees their pain and doesn't dismiss it. Who says this is real and I think it's so real that the courts should recognise your fear.”\", \"Publications aimed at LGBTQ+ and other diverse audiences are facing “good old-fashioned discrimination” as advertisers avoid them after political attacks on diversity and inclusion campaigns, editors have said.\\nSenior figures at publications aimed at the gay community and other minority groups said a previous “gold rush” to work with such titles was over.\\nThere has been a backlash in the US over corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the past 18 months, which has led to some big names rolling back their plans.\\nTag Warner, the chief executive of Gay Times, said his publication, which had been growing digitally in the US, had lost 80% of its advertisers in the past year. It has also lost in excess of £5m in expected advertiser revenue.\\nWarner, who has led the outlet since 2019, said his title's growth had been accompanied by an enthusiasm from brands to embrace LGBTQ+ audiences. He blames an anti-DEI drive in the US for the dramatic shift.\\n“I know that media and marketing is also going through a challenging year anyway, but when we're thinking about other organisations that don't talk to diverse themes, they're not nearly as impacted as we are,” he said. “This is just good old-fashioned discrimination. Because discrimination doesn't have to make business sense. Discrimination doesn't have to be logical. Discrimination is discrimination.\\n“We're really experiencing the impact of what happens when voices that are pressuring organisations to give in to less inclusive perspectives start winning. Then it creates this massive behavioural shift in brands and organisations.”\\nNafisa Bakkar, the co-founder of Amaliah, a publication aimed at “amplifying the voices of Muslim women”, said there had been a “change in mood” among brands and advertisers. “There was this DNI [diversity and inclusion] gold rush,” she said. “It is, I would say, well and truly over.\\n“We work with a lot of UK advertisers, but I would say that the US has a lot more emphasis on what they would call ‘brand safety', which I think is a code word for ‘we don't want to rock the boat'. I would say there is a lot more focus on this element.”\\nIbrahim Kamara, the founder of the youth platform GUAP, which has a large black and ethnically diverse audience, said he had detected a “relative difference” from 2020 in approaches from brands.\\nHe and others cited the economic pressures on advertisers generally in recent years. However, he said the “hype and the PR around wanting to support and connect with diverse audiences” had also subsided.\\n“The thing that most people within these kind of spaces can probably agree on is that the energy and the PR is very different now,” he said. “It was almost a badge of honour to be able to say that you're supporting certain communities. Now, I've seen that lots of the diversity and inclusion people that were hired around that period have probably lost their jobs. It doesn't have the same PR effect any more.”\\nWarner said the anti-DEI impact pre-dated the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Figures such as the conservative pundit Robby Starbuck have been engaged in a long-running anti-DEI campaign, pressuring firms to drop their diversity efforts. However, Warner said Trump's arrival “gave everyone, I think, permission to be honest about it”.\\nNot all publications in the sector have been hit in the same way as Gay Times. Companies with business models less reliant on US advertising, as well as some big players with long-established relationships, said they had managed to negotiate the changing political environment.\\n“Brands are nervous, that's for sure, or careful – or a combination of both,” said Darren Styles, the managing director of Stream Publishing, which publishes Attitude magazine. “They're aware it can be a lightning rod for a vocal minority. But our experience is that most people are holding their ground, if not doubling down.”\\nStyles also said he was not complacent, however, given the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform party in the UK and its lack of historical support for the LGBTQ+ community.\\n“I'm not incautious about the future,” he said. “Who knows what next year will bring, because that narrative is not going away. Obviously, there's the rise of Reform in the polls.\\n“[Farage] is quite clearly not an ally to our community and he's expressed disdain in the past at the awards we've given out to people in the trans community. So it is a worry as political momentum gains around there. But I think broadly, consumers in the UK are a bit more capable of thinking for themselves.”\\nMark Berryhill, the chief executive of equalpride, which publishes prominent US titles like Out and The Advocate, said some brands and agencies “may have been a little bit more cautious than they have been in the past”. However, he said it had so far meant deals had taken longer to be completed, in a tough economic climate.\\nHe said the political headwinds made it more important to highlight that working with such titles was simply a sound business decision. “We've tried to do a better job in this political climate of just selling the importance of our buying power,” he said. “Everybody's cautious and I don't think it's just LGBTQ. I think they're cautious in general right now with their work with minority owned companies.\\n“The one thing that maybe this whole controversy has helped us with a little bit is to really make brands realise it's a business decision. It's not just a charity or something you should do because you feel guilty.\\n“You should do it because it's the right thing to support LGBTQ journalism. We're small. We need to get the word out. We have important stories to tell. But it's also a good business decision. The more we show that side, certain brands will come along.”\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

       "[\"Images of Palestinian children in Gaza, emaciated by hunger under the blockade imposed by Israel, and of families grieving the more than 61,000 people killed in the territory have stirred outrage among foreign governments and much of the global public. Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly different.\\nIn a poll conducted in late July by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and suffering among Gaza's Palestinian population.\\nAccording to Anat Saragusti, an expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware of those reports because for months they have never seen them.\\n“Until a couple of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what's going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at all.”\\nIn the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas, and the country's military goals in Gaza. In that climate, the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas's attacks – although polls also show a clear majority want a deal with Hamas to end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.\\nMedia analysts say Israel's main broadcasters have largely embraced the narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country's history.\\nFor months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed up by Benjamin Netanyahu's claim last month: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAccording to UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza is going for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation.\\n“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread starvation”.\\nAccording to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October 2023.\\nEven Donald Trump, Netanyahu's key international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue, said: “I don't know … those children look very hungry … that's real starvation stuff.”  \\nIn a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza and dismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack Israel.\\nHe compared these images with a photograph of the Israeli hostage Evyatar David released by the Palestinian militant group early in August, pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death, the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular. The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the public of Gaza.\\nSaragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership, insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.”\\nAlthough Israel appears to exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recently filled the streets of Tel Aviv are now urging the government to halt the atrocities against the Palestinians.\\n“I think it is horrendous what is happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.”\\nGal Alkalay, 28, said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of our hostages.”\\nAnd yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals using the word “genocide” to describe their government's actions in Gaza – as the award-winning author David Grossman did just a fortnight ago – analysts say they remain a small minority.\\nIn Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align themselves with the narrative of Israel's political leadership.\\n\\nCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.\\nIsrael has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other restrictions include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.\\nPalestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over 180 killed since the conflict began.\\nThe committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.\\nForeign reporters based in Israel filed a legal petition seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by prominent journalists and media outlets have been ignored by the Israeli government.\\nTo ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual\\u200b\\u200b teams verif\\u200by photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.\\nEmma Graham-Harrison,\\xa0chief\\xa0Middle East correspondent\\n\\nAsked what she thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34, said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the security of our country.”\\nZalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas's ultimate aim is to get that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the whole world's face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.”\\nSince the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.\\nReporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have formally called for Gaza to be opened to foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.\\nMany argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the narrative.\\n“The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists, who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation but doesn't let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is starvation or not.”\\nUp to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded very well in its goal”.\",\n",
       " \"Good morning. Tony Blair is back and he has plans for the Middle East.\\nNo, you have not woken up and jumped back two decades in time. The former Labour leader, who was put under pressure to resign after the disastrous decision to go to war with Iraq – which led to the death of a million Iraqis and created a vacuum later filled by the brutal Islamic State – is back in the headlines this week.\\nBlair has attended a White House meeting with Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, according to recent reports.\\nThe former British prime minister has been working on a proposal for several months for the governance in Gaza after the war ends. The 72-year-old has reportedly been doing so with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, and the Emirati foreign minister Abdullah bin Zayed.\\nWho appears to be missing from this roundtable on who will govern Palestinians in Gaza? The Palestinians themselves. While reporting suggests Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas was briefed, there is little indication that Palestinians have any real say.\\nBut Palestinians are not voiceless as our current leaders often imply. Nor must they remain at the mercy of those more powerful. They also have their own plan for a postwar Gaza. To understand what leaders of Palestinian civil society are calling for, and what drives their continuing struggle for self-determination, I spoke to Ubai Al-Aboudi, director of the Bisan Center for Research and Development and member of the steering committee of the Palestinian NGO Network. He is based in Ramallah. That's after the headlines.\\nUkraine | The UK and European Union have summoned their Russian envoys after missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people and damaged British Council and EU offices.\\nUK news | The Treasury is reportedly considering a tax on landlords in the autumn budget that would target income from rents. The proposals are centred on the expansion of national insurance to include rental income.\\nIran | The UK, France and Germany have formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access to its nuclear sites.\\nUS news | The White House named non-scientist Jim O'Neill, a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr, to serve as acting head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), amid a standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez whose lawyers said she could only be removed by Donald Trump himself.\\nEnvironment | The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact.\\nAfter stepping down as UK prime minister in 2007, Tony Blair served as the UN Middle East envoy until 2015. He spent years visiting Jerusalem pushing for a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians, but there was no resolution, nor any meaningful development towards a Palestinian state.\\nDetails of the plans being discussed by Blair, the US and Israeli officials remain scarce for now.\\nThe far right in Israel remains animated by a proposal announced in February, weeks after Donald Trump was elected, in which the US president effectively called for Gaza to be ethnically cleansed, the land seized by the US, and an international resort built. The “Gaza Riviera” plan was widely condemned, including by western-backed Arab allies. Trump has been a lot quieter on this plan since.\\nIn July, reports emerged that Blair's thinktank worked with a project developing a postwar Gaza plan that included the creation of a “Trump Riviera” and a manufacturing zone named after Elon Musk. The project was led by Israeli business people using financial models developed by the US firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG).\\nThe Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) said it was not involved in the authorship of the plan but two staff members took part in calls as the project evolved. BCG has distanced itself significantly from the work in Gaza, reportedly firing two partners who it said had misled senior management.\\n“There is not a single Palestinian at the table” in these reported discussions, Ubai Al-Aboudi told me, “whether it's the Palestinian political leadership or representatives of Palestinian civil society and the wider Palestinian communities.” \\nHe added: “This is colonial practice. Palestinians must decide their own governance and future. But instead, while we are being genocided, the same powers complicit in the genocide are planning our future.”\\n***\\nWhat Palestinians want\\nAl-Aboudi dismissed Blair not only as a war criminal who must answer for the horrors that unfolded in Iraq, but for his role as the Middle Eastern envoy, “which failed in reining in Israel's policies of fragmentation, of, increased settlement activity, increased human rights violations against Palestinians, increased economic dependency of Palestinians”.\\nFrom the early days of the war in Gaza, Palestinian civil society has emphasised that any governance or rebuilding must have Palestinian agency at its core, Al-Aboudi explained, which factors in Palestinian cultural, historical, and socioeconomic heritage.\\n“It should take into account that 80% of the people living in Gaza, for example, are refugees whose fathers and grandfathers were ethnically cleansed from their villages back in 1948. It should take into account that there should be unity between the West Bank and Gaza, and it should take into account that the Israeli system of control over Palestinians cannot continue and should not be allowed or maintained. No Israeli should have a say or a call on the future of any Palestinian; this should be the number one lesson from this genocide,” Al-Aboudi said. “What's happening right now is totally different. Palestinian voices are being totally ignored. The Palestinian narrative is being erased.”\\nHe said Palestinian civil society embraced the Egypt plan for Gaza, which was backed by the Arab league and Europe, which would rebuild Gaza and support Palestinian technocrats, operating under the management of the Palestinian Authority (PA), to take over Gaza's governance. The plan, which includes elections, would eventually lead to Gaza and the West Bank coming together as part of a Palestinian state.\\n“We have called for … a democratically elected leadership that would guide our people towards freedom … that would lift up our people. Unfortunately, all of these calls have fallen on deaf ears, whether from the international community or the US,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe denial of Palestinian autonomy\\nLife for Palestinians in the West Bank means being trapped between a rock and a hard place: the Israeli occupation on one side and a Palestinian Authority that works with it on the other.\\nAl-Aboudi's organisation, Bisan, works to secure socioeconomic rights for Palestinians and to advocate on their behalf “not just against Israeli occupation but also the Palestinian Authority and big business when they violate people's rights”.\\n“Our work has put us in the crosshairs of everyone. I've been arrested by both Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian Authority. Our organisation has been targeted, but we're still operational, pushing for the basic right of Palestinians to live in dignity.”\\nBut even the western-backed PA, widely criticised by many Palestinians for its role in working closely with the Israeli occupation, has been excluded from discussions about Gaza's future. That's largely down to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other Israeli ministers who have firmly ruled out any role for the PA in Gaza.\\n“What we have now is a propped-up dictator, Mahmoud Abbas, who was elected in 2005 for a four-year period that has now stretched for more than 20 years. He has been kept in power by outside support, not popular support. And now, even this propped-up leadership is not being consulted on what kind of leadership or governance should exist; let alone … the Palestinian community itself, the people who are going through the genocide right now,” Al-Aboudi said.\\n***\\nThe work continues\\nFor Al-Aboudi, the denial of Palestinian agency has been a process that has unfolded over many decades.\\nIn 2021, Israel designated Bisan Centre and five other human rights organisations in the occupied territories as terrorists. This was widely rebuffed by the international community.\\n“Israel has always worked to stifle any kind of Palestinian agency … We have always been subjected to Israeli harassment.” But he explained that the sucker punch was landed when the Israeli government designated Bisan under the same label as al-Qaida and Islamic State. “Can you imagine that? Civil society organisations that write reports, provide aid for people, provide legal counselling, communicate to the world, to the UN, what is happening here, are being treated in the same way as IS?” Al-Aboudi said.\\nYet the work continues. “We believe in every human being in the world. We believe in equality, we believe in dignity, and we believe our people deserve it like any other people around the world.”\\nWith the Palestinians living amid one of their darkest chapters in their history, I asked Al-Aboudi why he still holds on to hope.\\n“This is the only thing that keeps us going … When we see millions of people on the streets of London or Manchester, or in Sydney, Australia … this gives us hope. We know that righteousness is on our side. We know that the people of the world feel for what we are going through,” he said.\\nAnd, he added, that regardless of what is being planned in backrooms, he ultimately believes that political agency will, at the end of the day, lie with the people. “The people have the power, and the people can claim back their political agency from corrupt governments and businesses.”\\nPatrick Greenfield has a fascinating look at the genuinely serious work of tackling invasive hornets threatening UK pollinators.

After the disaster, a public inquiry struggled to form a complete picture of the event. This documentary series on iPlayer, copes with the challenge superbly, leaning heavily on survivor testimony – 61 men escaped from the rig – and combining it with a simple 2D diagram of the platform's layout to give us the fullest picture possible. The shocking story is skilfully told by those unfussy dramatisations of the survivors' words, as the actors leave us in no doubt about how deeply traumatised the men were by their experience. Jack Seale\\nMusicBlood Orange: Essex Honey | ★★★★★This is an exquisitely eclectic portrait of grief. It combines gorgeous melodies with dancefloor rhythms, indie pop and languorous funk – and cameos from Lorde and Zadie Smith. Its primary mood is a very British kind of late summer-into-autumn melancholy: there's a hazy, sunlit quality to a lot of the sounds. The melodies are frequently gorgeous, but inescapably sad. Inspired by the death of Hynes's mother, the lyrics evoke both Greater London's urban sprawl – “Ilford is the place that I hold dear,” he sings on The Last of England – and its more pastoral surroundings, the latter a relief from “the broken light” of the city on countryside. Alexis Petridis\\nFilmIn the Nguyen Kitchen | ★★★★☆In this heartwarming feature debut, Stéphane Ly-Cuong turns to the magic of the musical comedy to portray not only the dreams and the struggles of Vietnamese-French artists, but also a side of Paris seldom seen on screen. A hopeful performer and singer, Yvonne Nguyen (Clotilde Chevalier) can't help but dream in songs. Without much luck getting cast in acting roles, Yvonne moves back in with her mother (Anh Tran-Nghia), who runs a restaurant in the outskirts of Paris. This push-and-pull lays bare the barriers faced in an industry where Asian characters are often seen as interchangeable. Phuong Le\\nTheatreJuniper Blood (Donmar Warehouse, London) | ★★★☆☆Mike Bartlett's invigorating play is a drama about whether it is possible to live responsibly in our age of toxic capitalism. It begins as a blended-family satire with eco-arguments and generational clash bolted on. But with each act the ground on its earthy set turns, developing into what might be a state-of-the-nation play. Are the characters who seek freedom in fact in retreat? Is localism just a yearning for a purer past and can we rewild our way to a new pastoral idyll? Despite its lecturing and trowel-load of ideas, it is compelling and ambitious. Bartlett masterfully weds levity through social satire with complexity and depth of subject matter.

       " \"An Israeli security cabinet meeting, which had been expected to discuss Benjamin Netanyahu's call for the “full occupation” of Gaza, has been postponed amid mounting tensions over whether the plan is feasible.\\nAmid a stalling of ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israeli officials had briefed local and international media that the prime minister was considering an expansive offensive, aimed at taking full control of the Palestinian territory after 22 months of war against the militant group Hamas.\\nHowever, senior Israeli military officers and former senior commanders warned the plan would endanger the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, risk further international isolation of Israel and require Israeli soldiers to administer a population in which Hamas fighters were still present.\\nAny move towards full occupation is likely to be strongly resisted by large parts of the international community, already horrified by the conduct of Israel's military campaign.\\nOn Tuesday, Trump declined to say whether he supported or opposed a potential military takeover of Gaza by Israel and said his administration's focus was on increasing food access to the Palestinian territory .\\n“I know that we are there now trying to get people fed,” Trump told reporters. “As far as the rest of it, I really can't say. That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.” \\nLate on Tuesday, a senior UN official warned that expanding Israeli military operations inside the territory “would risk catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza”.\\nAddressing the UN security council in New York, Miroslav Jenča, the assistant secretary general for Europe, central Asia and the Americas, said: “There is no military solution to the conflict in Gaza or the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”\\nChina's deputy UN representative, Geng Shuang, expressed “great concern” about the reported plans for Gaza and added: “We urge Israel to immediately halt such dangerous actions.” He called for a ceasefire and urged countries with influence to take concrete steps to help bring one about.\\nIsrael's scorched-earth campaign has obliterated large parts of Gaza, killed more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forced nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people from their homes and created what a global hunger monitor last week called an unfolding famine.\\nThat has caused widespread international anger and prompted the UK to say it would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against Israel. Several other European countries including Portugal and Finland have recently signed a statement declaring their willingness to recognize the state of Palestine as an essential step towards a two-state solution.\\nThe disquiet follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion.\\n“The die has been cast. We're going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu.\\nBy Tuesday, however, evidence had emerged of deep splits between Netanyahu and senior military officials, including the chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who reportedly voiced opposition to the plan, prompting calls for his dismissal.\\nAbsent at a security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu did, however, meet security officials, but not in a decision-making setting. His office said later that the Israeli military would carry out any decision made in cabinet. \\nDuring a visit to an army training facility earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “It is necessary to complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, to free all our hostages and to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.”\\nMilitary analysts in the Israeli media, channelling some defence officials, were also sceptical. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the military affairs commentator Yossi Yehoshua described the risks of the proposal. “Hostages … will die, large numbers of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers will be killed as well as a serious logistical problem – where to house the roughly 1 million civilians who are now in Gaza City.\\n“Currently, Israel simply doesn't have legitimacy either to continue to fight in Gaza or to establish a city of refugees on its ruins.”\\nIsraeli officials have said Netanyahu discussed a plan with the White House as it attempted to portray Hamas as having walked away from ceasefire negotiations, a claim denied by Hamas, which blamed Israel for the protracted impasse.\\nWhile the Trump administration has not commented on the Netanyahu proposal, it has been given some credence by leaked comments made by the US envoy Steve Witkoff to Israeli hostage families at the weekend, suggesting his proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining living hostages had failed.\\nWitkoff added that Donald Trump “now believes that everybody should come home at once. No piecemeal deals,” adding they were now pursuing an “all or nothing” plan.\\nAt the centre of the Netanyahu plan is the notion that, by surrounding areas where hostages are believed to be held, Israeli forces can raid those areas and rescue the captives, a policy that has broadly failed during the past two years of war.\\nAmid questions over the practicality of a wider offensive, some have speculated that Netanyahu's call may be more rhetorical than real in substance, aimed at keeping onboard far-right ministers who have demanded they be allowed to build settlements in Gaza.\\nA Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.\\n“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” the official told Reuters, requesting not to be named.\\nPractically, too, it is unclear whether Israel has the capacity for the kind of expanded operation described.\\nThe IDF has struggled with manpower issues as the war drags on, with reservists being repeatedly called up amid concerns over a mental health crisis that has included a number of suicides.\\n\\n\\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\\n\\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\\n\\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\\n\\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

An earlier version said that the situation in Gaza had prompted “several European countries to say they would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire”. This is the particular position of the UK government; additional detail has been included about the position of some other European countries.\"]"

    "Documents that are alone, too far from, or hovering between multiple topics are not given a topic and coloured light grey. These are the documents assigned `-1` also known as 'noise'. This doesn't mean they're meaningless, just that they do not easily fit into a cluster and so BERTopic is cautious about assigning one.\n",

    "A cluster is determined when a document is considered significantly closer to one set of documents than they are another, and that there are a decent number of documents all closer to one another than they are to anyone else. BERTopic uses an algorithm called HDBSCAN to find clusters of documents. Clusters are not necessarily circular, but can stretch across the 'page' or form irregular shapes. There may also occasionally be a document out of place, such as a different topic document in the middle of a cluster. This is firstly because HDBSCAN is designed to find oddly shaped cluters, because texts tend to cluster in odd ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly it is because when BERTopic determines these clusters, it's actually using more than two dimensions to determine document similarity (5 by default). Here we are forcing it to show document similarity in only two dimensions, meaning there may be the occasional document that seems to be misplaced. If we were able to see all five dimensions those misplaced documents would actually be a part of their cluster.\n",

    "> ### Wait, how many dimensions?\n",
    "> Remember in our vectors session we showed that BERT embeddings represent documents in 384 dimensions that are meant to fully capture the nuanced differences between them. |\n",
    "> BERTopic takes those 384 dimensions and uses a clever process called UMAP to reduce the number of dimensions down to 5 whilst still maintaining enough information to express those document differences. It is those 5 dimensions that BERTopic then examines to find the 'clusters' in the data where documents are densely packed together to then identify topics."
